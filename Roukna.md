# Project1

* **Size of *work units***: Each worker mines bitcoins of fixed length 32. We split the string into 
two parts of length 12 and 20. When a worker requests the server for work, the 
server generates a random string of length 12 and passes it to the worker. The 
worker then recursively mines for bitcoins. On each computation, the worker 
generates the latter part of the string (of length 20) and appends it to the 
string prefix sent by the server and the gator ID. Thus, the worker generates 
the candidate string and further hashes it to check for leading zeroes.

## Example:
Server generated prefix (length = 12; sent to worker) - fba4e19ea38be
Worker generated suffix (length = 20) - 8df9c2ff9944c542db5
Candidate string - <gator_id> <> fba4e19ea38be <> 8df9c2ff9944c542db5

By generating the prefix string of length 12 every time a worker requests for 
work, we ensure that no two workers will work on the same string. Generating 
the latter part of the string of length 20 randomly on the nodes induces even 
more randomness in generation of the candidate string, thus, ensuring lesser 
collision in the bitcoins generated by the different workers.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `project1` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:project1, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
