Demo on new Cristal+ version: <http://w3.tap.ibm.com/medialibrary/media_view?id=383345>:::devops
I watched the demo and played around with version 2.7. The tool is impressive. There's a lot we can learn from the set-up and where to create this insights in other business areas. Great!:::devops
I know! I was also very impressed! Wonderful that this already exists and is available for us to use!:::devops
Team - in 2016 I was using Notes vacation planner. With notes being less used every day, what do you suggest to replace vacation planner? Shall we go for the web version?:::devops
our team in Victoria uses the web based vacation planner @ <https://vplanner.dst.ibm.com/>:::devops
it works very well for us:::devops
does the web version update your notes/ verse calendar?:::devops
no, that is the one drawback. you have to update your verse calendar separately. it is a great tool for the whole team to see where everyone is though. so it has pros/cons :slightly_smiling_face::::devops
I am thinking to give it a try this year:::devops
One nice feature of vplanner is that it has a calendar feed for each of your teams.  So if you’re using Notes you can add that calendar to Notes. However, Notes doesn’t sync those calendar entries to your Notes database so you won’t see them in Verse.:::devops
Cool, thanks everyone for feedback! I was able to influence my local manager for us to give it a try on VacationPlanner on the web this year! Yay! :slightly_smiling_face::::devops
Not sure if you have seen this, but I saw the events and thought they were interesting to us....:::devops

If you don't have access to the internal CDO community (<http://ibm.biz/internal-cdo>), please let me know.  Thanks!:::devops
hi <@W448040MV> would you please grant community access to me? thx:::devops
<@W43F25BGB> added you and <@W43KD1FHA> ..   if someone can provide a CSV file with every email address under Bill Bailey, I'll add everyone to the community.:::devops
thanks <@W448040MV> . Am sure there's a way to export from bluepages... I just don't know the method. I'll soon be moving out from under Bill to Somesh/Emily's group.:::devops
i didn't see something. but there should be a way, i agree:::devops
when you move, we can move your sub communities from business integration to governance:::devops
or we can do that rightnow if you're already working on that team:::devops
<@W448040MV>: if everyone is granted access to the community they should also be able to see the video that I recorded about Github and Zenhub.:::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> - that's correct..  we wanted to share that more broadly, so now many more have access:::devops

Team, thank you for the material on ZenHub! I will go through it carefully :slightly_smiling_face::::devops
Great vid .... Thank you for sharing:::devops
No access to ZenHub:::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> <@W448040MV> Are there any plans to establish an Artifactory code repository for the CEDP? Are people using Travis or Jenkins for CI builds?:::devops
<@W43KD0LJY> Travis for CI.  I'm not familiar with Artifactory other than I've heard it can be used as a docker repository. Is that what you're thinking?  If so, the answer should be yes that we want a docker registry, but the jury is out in terms of which one to use.:::devops
<@W43DLJD8D>: do you have access to the zen hub materials that were shared yesterday?:::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> Artifactory is something like a generic repository. Docker, RPM, DEB, Maven - it’s all supported. We’ve used it in the past with very good experience. It will be useful if code is shared between squads. I believe that this it not yet the case.:::devops
If I understand correctly, <@W43KD0LJY>, Artifactory is a good place to store artifacts generated from the build process, for example, binary packages that are launched to containers.  I think we need something like that, specifically because that helps quickly change images in production, if for example, we have to roll-back:::devops
That’s one use case, there are others. If my code depends on a library of some other sub-project and I want to keep up with that other sub-project, the easiest solution is to create a dependency and pull the latest dependency from artifactory. We’ve used that in several projects in the past (that are now products).:::devops
<@W43F22267|carolynlacombe> has joined the channel:::devops
<@W448040MV> can you give me the access to the Zenhub community?:::devops
<@W43KPLP45> what access don't you have?  because you have been able to access the repository, right?:::devops
no, I can't:::devops
no access to the documentation and video:::devops
oh, that:::devops
:ok_hand::::devops
&gt; Artifactory is something like a generic repository. Docker, RPM, DEB, Maven - it’s all supported. 

Good to know, thanks for the info.  I think this is something we’re going to need and I can see it being used as both a registry for inputs to the builds (external dependencies, etc) as well as build outputs (docker images, tarballs, jars, etc)

&gt; It will be useful if code is shared between squads.

Absolutely.

&gt; I believe that this it not yet the case.

Correct, and we need to get working on this.:::devops
<!channel> - please forgive me for the spam, but looking for engineering contacts in CleverSafe and SoftLayer to survey their dev practices.  Any contacts someone can share or introductions they can make?:::devops
<@W448040MV> contact Raj Rajendran. He used to work for me and is in Softlayer. He might be able to point you in the right direction:::devops
thank you <@W43H2R0QJ>, I'll reach out:::devops
<@W448040MV> - My local manager (<mailto:julianap@br.ibm.com|julianap@br.ibm.com>) works directly with the Blue Cloud teams and has connection with the Softlayer teams. She indicated their Softlayer OnBoarding Lead - Amit Verma for this contact <http://w3.ibm.com/newbp/profile.html?uid=582098744>:::devops

Tip on Webinar - Specially for Scrum Masters, Squad Leads and Managers  :wink: : Servant Leadership: A Deeper Dive #pmkn17
Speakers: Robert Purdie
Date: Thursday, February 2nd 2017
Time: 02:00 PM (UTC-02:00)
Duration: 60 minutes
ABOUT THIS SESSION

In September of 2016, Rob Purdie presented “The Project Manager’s Bridge to Servant Leadership”. In this session, Rob will take a deeper dive into the topic, and describe how servants-as-leaders can help Agile team members relate to one another in less coercive and more creatively supporting ways, and ultimately, deliver better outcomes.

<@W448040MV> What is the thought around how we are going to bring API services to CeDP:::devops
<!channel> If you’re entering issues into Github (stories, epics, issues, etc) please make sure you add a *meaningful* description as well as a title.  Oftentimes we assume that others share our mental context (I know I make this assumption sometimes) and having both a description and a title helps disseminate our thinking and allows others to collaborate more effectively.:::devops
Also, if you haven’t already: please ensure that you have a profile picture that includes your face for both Slack and Github.  It’s tough to get a sense of a person when looking at the autogenerated images.:::devops
<@W43DLJD8D> How are you attempting to access Zenhub?:::devops
<@W43H2R0QJ> Services that provide APIs will generally get their data from JDBC, with perhaps some amount of local caching/storage. These services can run either on VMs provisioned on the Zurich infrastructure or on BlueCloud.  The choice is dependent on the performance characteristics of your API service.:::devops
<@W448040MV> so there should be no problems running the Weather Channel APIs?:::devops
<@W43H2R0QJ> that might not be true:::devops
there shouldn't a problem developing a service with new APIs:::devops
but what does it mean to run the Weather APIs?:::devops
<@W448040MV> good question…. we are going to have a lot of data providers with pull APIs. Sounds like another topic to discuss :grinning::::devops
So we use these APIs to pull data into our lake, is that what I understand, <@W43H2R0QJ>?:::devops
this is on the ingestion side?:::devops
<@W448040MV> <@W43H2R0QJ> Are we going to use an API management platform such as APIm as a layer for managing APIs?:::devops
<@W448040MV> correct:::devops
Probably need to refer to Sean Rooney for a question of that type.:::devops
<@W448040MV> <@W43H2R0QJ> Leading question: what is the access and security controls around APIs?:::devops
do we have a general conversation channel for these kinds of topics?:::devops
<@W3S3P9KN2> right now, my plan is to control who has access to the API keys. They will have to sign a DOU (to be developed, but we have samples) .. to get the key:::devops
ok. We should document that:::devops
are we using APIs in 0.5, or is this a 1.0 conversation?:::devops
0.5. I have early adopters who need to use ingestion APIs:::devops
how are these keys generated <@W43H2R0QJ>:::devops
They are generally provided by the external company:::devops

How Data Modeling Fits into an Overall Enterprise Architecture
DATE: January 26, 2017
TIME: 2 PM Eastern / 11 AM Pacific 
PRICE: Free to all attendees.
About the Webinar
Enterprise Architecture (EA) provides a visual blueprint of the organization, and shows key interrelationships between data, process, applications, and more.  By abstracting these assets in a graphical view, it’s possible to see key interrelationships, particularly as it relates to data and its business impact across the organization. Join this webinar for a discussion on how a data model can be combined with an overall enterprise architecture for enhanced business value and success.

<@W3S3P9KN2> - I can't remember where you posted originally, but I just made time to read this article you shared some other day and I have to say... WOW! So obvious, yet so hard to accomplish. And the author, designs it very well! Thank you for sharing this! :heart: <https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/modern-agile/>:::devops
How many times have we see teams focusing on explaining why they CANNOT get something done? This team showed that, it's amazing what you CAN DO when you focus on resolving the problem. Inspiring essay to start the day! :slightly_smiling_face:

Team, does anyone know if the GCDO has picked a Tool for sharing vacation days? (i.e: vacation planner on web, or vacation planner notes db etc):::devops
I was hoping for the web version:::devops
me 2, I'd vote for that one too:::devops
I think we came with Charlie to the conclusion that notes vacation planner version 1.18 works for all. Here's the link: <http://w3-01.ibm.com/hr/web/us/empservices/forms/vacplanner.html#ht>:::devops
<@W43KPEXHB|007> has joined the channel:::devops
We all in Victoria already use the web vaction planner and it seems to work great: <https://vplanner.dst.ibm.com/login>:::devops
<@W43H2QZSN> my Notes VP 1.18 does not allow me to import other calendars. That could be because others are on a different version. I still vote for the online version:::devops
<@W3S3P9KN2>  I tinkered with the VP web tool yesterday. Had trouble getting the iCal feed working into my Notes (not Verse) client (some sort of SSLException error). Have you or anyone tried/succeeded doing that. And.... as a follow-up (if that feature can work), will importing one's VP details into Notes block one's busy time for days they have scheduled vacation. Thx:::devops
<@W43F25BGB>: is that the same tool that <@W3PQ51X53> mentioned?  If so I managed to get the feed in Notes.:::devops
<@W3S3P9KN2>  Yes. I set up a 1-person team with only myself in it, then did an export to iCal and got the URL, which I tried to add as a feed into Notes. Glad to know it can work... must be something local on my side. If I get time I might surf the VP community for assistance.:::devops
&gt; as a follow-up (if that feature can work), will importing one's VP details into Notes block one's busy time for days they have scheduled vacation

No, it doesn’t.  iCal feeds on your Notes calendar don’t block off the time.:::devops
Thanks, <@W3S3P9KN2> . I suspected that was the  answer. That's too bad. To me, that means I would still need to manage my vacation in Notes (via the 15+-yr old) vacation tool, then use the new web-based tool. Not venting to you.... I'm not a fan of the old tool, but it works.:::devops
<@W43F25BGB> yeah, I think it will be a little cumbersome to start:::devops
I vote for <https://vplanner.dst.ibm.com/login> too. That would reduce my calendars to maintain back to 2 :grinning::::devops

"Too often, organizations focus merely on the functional role and hope that good team performance somehow follows. This is why even the most expensive professional sports teams often fail to perform according to the individual talents of each player: There is no psychological synergy."

"The bottom line is that employees are happiest when the boss knows what she or he is talking about, and that drives performance: there is growing evidence, from randomized trials done under laboratory conditions, that when you make workers happier they become more productive.

So, here's what was on my mind - yesterday I thought about working on  the creation of a spreadsheet, collaboratively. The idea is to create a spreadsheet to track all Watson products and services, thus many of us and even from other teams, could benefit from the information in it.  However, when I decided to post the document to gather some feedback from my P.O. , I wasn't unsure where to do so... To me, best place (to discuss) would be an activity in our internal / restricted community and have the file loaded in BOX. This way, the debate would happen "offline" and the file would not be "polluted" with discussion and considerations on its building process. But our internal community does not have this feature (activities).:::devops
This makes me think, that we should also define a "process" for our documentation... because we have folders in BOX (like, at least one per squad - but not in like a main folder), we have folders pinned in Slack, We have files attached to the community, we have stuff through email , Mural.... :scream::::devops
how do we define “Watson”. I just learned that the eCommerce BU has been renamed to Watson Customer Engagement:::devops
I am not sure how you see / feel about this:::devops
<@W43H2R0QJ> , I would define it as products / services to support cognition:::devops
<@W3PJFN525> - i think our document organization is a big mess here.  We're using too many of the wrong tools:::devops
<@W448040MV> I agree with ‘too many':::devops
the tools we use are often so limited, with this one I'm typing on at the moment a nice exception:::devops
the infra team internally is using Confluence:::devops
and that I really like.:::devops
just throwing it out there.:::devops
confluence is pretty good:::devops
we love it.:::devops
all internal admin docs is in confluence:::devops
i'd like to continue to discuss with CIO about using Google GSuite - then we can use Google Sites, Google Groups, Google Docs, etc.:::devops
confluence is just a simple wiki:::devops
I don't know Confluence, Zoltan. Can you share / do a demo?:::devops
<youtube://atlassian> confluence :slightly_smiling_face::::devops
it’s not free:::devops
no, it’s not:::devops
the good stuff isn’t free.:::devops
we need to pay for our tools no matter what:::devops
we used to use Confluence wiki in IBM.. it was replaced by Communities:::devops
$10/user/month for a replacement to Verse, to Box, to Zoom, to Confluence, to Microsoft Office, to Connections Cloud is a good deal:::devops
<@W43H2R0QJ> communities is the most useless thing I’ve ever seen:::devops
<@W43KD3AMA> basically agree, but I’m in a room full of lawyers, so it’s a tough call:::devops
:slightly_smiling_face::::devops
<@W43KD3AMA> - there are many useless tools floating around here.. hard to pick one:::devops
:slightly_smiling_face::::devops
It's hard to pick one. But my take is: we need to create a flow, a system:::devops
or we'll get lost:::devops
if we can't pay now, I suggest we create some guidelines, perhaps...:::devops
pay is less of an issue than CIO being the one supporting it:::devops
there's very little appetite to go around CIO - and i agree - better to work with those who are responsibe:::devops
if they can provide jira and confluence I’m a happy camper:::devops
What do you propose on this topic? Should we meet and come up with an action plan? Do we want to ask for approval on some tool right away and then take it from there?:::devops
suggest writing down some use cases to help define the problem we are trying to solve. there may be a difference in strategy/tool for documentation depending on the consumer of the doc -- e.g., an internal (for CDO-eyes only) design doc versus a how-to guide:::devops
So, I just saw this conversation should have happened in the <#C3QH39325|engagementsquad>  channel? Is this correct <@W43H2R0QJ>  ? Is this part of your Squad's mission? -- I may have misread / misunderstood this on another conversation thread:::devops
we are focused on engagement with our stakeholders. I think this is a discussion for <#C3TM2E81W|cdotools>:::devops
<@W43H2R0QJ> <@W3PJFN525> <@W43F25BGB> <@W43KD3AMA> - yes can we switch this up to <#C3TM2E81W|cdotools>:::devops
<@W43KD1K52|lga-zurich> has joined the channel:::devops
<!channel> All this chief data office channel will soon be migrated to Enterprise licensed channel that enables confidential discussions. Target date is Friday February 10th.  I will keep you informed.  :::devops
Awesome!!!!:::devops
can we migrate over our channels and conversations, or do we start new?:::devops
I have requested they migrate all. :::devops
Slack has to be involved hence it is taking time. :::devops
When the Sales Connect team was migrated to the enterprise license all channels and direct messages were unaffected including all history. Also we got back all the lost history. I can't remember what the non-enterprise limit is.. something like only the last 100k messages are visible (limit is shared across all channels and direct message) but the overage still exists and will be visible again with the enterprise license.:::devops
10K:::devops
<@W42RPR5U0|delia> has joined the channel:::devops
<@W3ZHPFJN6> thx:::devops
<!channel> I’m ready to post the working copy of the worklist for Feb 15 (list of apps and activities). We have many folders going on…. Any issue if I use the Governance Work product folder?:::devops
that is OK with me.:::devops
you can also post in <http://ibm.biz/internal-cdo> -:::devops
that has everyone of interest:::devops
but i think the other folder is fine as well:::devops
What kind of a list of apps and activities?:::devops
the agreed upon list of apps between CDO and Zurich, and list the activities like DOU in place, Bluegroups linked to CEDP schema’s etc:::devops
<@W448040MV> I would have thought you prefer Box since you can edit realtime on the web:::devops
<https://ibm.box.com/s/i9h7x7lu0y12dr98il1pj4nm5dv6kqa9>:::devops
I would prefer adding it to Files. Share readonly with internal cdo community and grant edit access to those few you may need to if needed. Makes it accessible from community and editable if needed and authorized. :::devops
I guess I am OK wherever.. We seem to have multiple places that have been used. This is an important doc, so it should be somewhere fairly visible to the CDO community:::devops
we have also put several related docs in GitHub in the documentation folder. I wouldn’t mind it being there either:::devops
Hard to find in Git.  You will find an example of how I have the readiness spreadsheet. In <http://ibm.biz/internal-cdo>  files you will the file , can launch and view or.edit from there. :::devops
<@W44804XB9|zor> has joined the channel:::devops
realtime editing I think works better in Files.:::devops

<!channel> out channel here <http://chiefdataoffice.slack.com|chiefdataoffice.slack.com> is migrating to Slack Enterprise on Thursday, February 9th at 6pm EST.   During the migration slack will be unavailable with an estimated outage time of 10 minutes.   After the migration completes users will be forced to login using IBM SSO.   
 
In order to ensure we are ready for the migration we need to ensure all users are registered in slack with their ibm email address.  If you are please do so now.  Additionally keep in mind that if you are using this channel on your mobile device, you will need MaaS for a secure connection.   I know that I will have to do that!:::devops

<!channel> Everyone: we recently had an instance where a filename with a colon (":") in it was committed to Git. While this is a valid filename under Linux, when that repository was updated on Windows, it ran into some weird behavior (the filename was truncated starting at the colon, and the file contents were empty). Git then saw this as the original file having been deleted and the file with the truncated name as being new:
```$ git status
On branch 439-CLI-Enhancements
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

        deleted:    test-cases/DC5/DC5: Data Analysts can query and analyze data using BigSQL.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

        test-cases/DC5/DC5

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

We need to take care that things will work across all platforms, so we need to avoid using special characters in filenames.  The characters that are bad are `&lt; &gt; : " / \ | ? *`. Thanks!:::devops
<@W43H2R0QJ> I got "folder has been removed or unavailable to you"  Would you be able to give me access to the Table list, please?:::devops

Terrific! This will allow us to share confidential information on slack.:::devops
"The need for more data storytellers is only going to increase in the future. With the shift towards more self-service capabilities in analytics and business intelligence, the pool of people generating insights will expand beyond just analysts and data scientists. This new breed of data tools will make it easier for people across business functions to access and explore the data on their own. As a result, we’re going to see an unprecedented number of insights being generated within companies than ever before. However, unless we can improve the communication of these insights we will also see a poorer insight-to-value conversion rate. If an insight isn’t understood and isn’t compelling, no one will act on it and no change will occur."  <http://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/03/31/data-storytelling-the-essential-data-science-skill-everyone-needs/#466a9a90f0c8>:::devops

"Not sure if this info has already been shared before. I am currently attending a great series called Zero to Cognitive. It is 12 chapters/excercises from 15 min to 60 min. Robert Dill, who is a DE and CTO, is presenting in a clear way. You learn from scratch how to use bluemix, github and develop in Watson with: speech to text, text to speech, NLC, Conversation, Retrieve and Rank and Alchemy."

Team - not sure if you have seen this announcement : <https://w3-connections.ibm.com/blogs/4ed8da0b-e1ac-4ced-8671-d87a8b18bc4a/entry/New_IT_Security_Standard_Announcement?lang=en_us> 

"The new IT Security Standard provides a single, unified security standard for IT environments; replacing both ITCS 104 and the Cloud Security Policy. Solution teams may begin using the new standard immediately. The legacy security standards will remain available and your Business Unit Information Security Officer (BISO) will provide guidance and timelines to transition to the new standard. In the spirit of Agile, we welcome your feedback on your implementation of the new standard. Your personal experience will help us to course correct as we learn more.":::devops
We are getting ready to allow non-CDO access to this domain. Please let me or <@W3S3P9KN2> know if a channel should be made private, otherwise it will remain open to anyone who joins the domain.:::devops

Hi team, good morning... Good news in this blog entry that Safari is coming back :slightly_smiling_face: <https://w3-connections.ibm.com/blogs/92423b28-353a-49d9-9d5d-d21cd1de10be/entry/safari-is-back?lang=en_us>:::devops

<@W3ZAPB5T4> Hi... is this the Apple browser, or an app for some other purpose? I read the blog and it wasn't clear. I know Safari as the browser for iOS.:::devops
Hi Will... He had to stop using Safari in 2017 because IBM didn't renew our contract with them (We had a pilot agreement in 2016). Now IBM settled a contract with them so we will be able to use it again. To your question, I assume both the apple browser, apps, Windows etc versions will be available to us again.:::devops
Hi Diego,  Thanks for letting us know!    I had been waiting to start another course on Safari Books since the beginning of January.:::devops

ATTENTION: The CDO Slack Team will begin allowing non-CDO members beginning April 3rd.  If you wish to restrict your channel, please convert it to a Private channel.  If you require assistance in doing this, please reach out to one of the CDO Slack Team admins <@W3S3P9KN2> , <@W43H2R0QJ> , <@W3ZHPFJN6> , <@W448040MV> or me:::devops
<@W42SHLPJM> As per the Slack documentation, only Team Owners and Admins are able to convert channels from public to private.

&gt; Who can convert public channels
&gt;
&gt; By default, Team Owners and Admins can convert channels from public to private, but regular team members don't have this option. If Team Owners prefer to restrict this option further, they can limit private channel creation to Team Owners only from the Settings &amp; Permissions page.
&gt;
&gt;    Only Team Owners: Select the Team Owners only preference to restrict private channel creation and public channel conversion to just Team Owners. 
&gt;    Team Owners and Admins: Select any other option to allow Admins to continue to have access to converting public channels (in addition to creating private channels).

<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/213185467-Make-a-public-channel-private>:::devops
I think this means that everyone will need to reach out for assistance if they want to do this — there’s no self-serve option.:::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> Thanks Bryan.  We will respond to requests to convert channels:::devops
<@W42SHLPJM> great, thanks.  Let’s start with <#C3A1AEG03|gts-client-rentention> :smile::::devops

<@W3PJFN525|coca> uploaded a file: <https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/files/coca/F4SES6WH3/sun_rise|Gratitude &amp; A beautiful movie of our story> and commented: Hello Everyone,
 
I am leaving IBM and this has been one of the hardest decisions I have ever made in my life.
 
IBM has supported my personal and professional growth in so many ways... and I have met such awesome, creative, passionate, innovative people during my stay here.
 
Everybody who knows me, knows how much I have loved every single day I worked and lived in this company for the past 12 years. I have put all my love, passion and dedication here all these years, every single day, in everything I've done, every person I met, every job I had, all that I learned, all the opportunities I had to make a difference...
 
All my gratitude to each one of you, who worked alongside with me, in each step of this journey.
 
I am about to start a new chapter in my life, moving to a new country, in a new continent, to start a new job, new weather, new culture... Away from family and all I am familiar with... In my bag, I will carry everything I learned with you all, all my 'tools' to use in life. In my heart and my mind, this beautiful movie of our story, while I continue my mission transforming this world into a better place. :heart:
 
Many mixed feelings about this move, so I really hope this is a 'see you soon' message. Let's stay in touch! After all, "what goes around, comes around" and who knows what future holds for us? :slightly_smiling_face:

<!here|@here> On March 8, we announced to all our CDO Teams, the CEDP Support Policy and Process.  Today we are announcing an additional enhancement to this Policy.  The enhancement is as follows:

"For all major Projects, all Code (e.g., SQL, Scripts) should be stored in CEDP GitHub Repository at <http://ibm.biz/cedp-code|ibm.biz/cedp-code>.  This will allow for review, improvement, etc. as they are deployed to the Platform.":::devops
is there documentation on naming conventions? folder names etc?:::devops
I think the general convention is to do what you think is appropriate and then everyone piles on telling you why you’re wrong.:::devops
But seriously, I’m assuming you’re referring to putting documentation in source control in the cognitive-data-platform project, what type of docs are you wanting to add?:::devops
I’m referring to the requirement to store all source code in GitHub ( I agree), but there needs to be a structure to it…. let’s take this conversation to <#C3TM2E81W|cdotools>:::devops
good plan:::devops

interesting:::devops
<!channel> I’d like to propose that we enable some restrictions to the CEDP repository (<https://github.ibm.com/cognitive-data-platform/cognitive-data-platform>) that should improve stability of our build.  There are 2 things that we can enable:

1. Travis CI build *must* pass before allowing a merge.

Enabling this option will ensure that no one can deliver a breaking build to the `master` branch.  The downside is that you will have to wait for a CI build to complete before you can merge a pull request but realistically you should have been doing that anyway.  This should not affect any topic branches, it’s really just a gating mechanism to ensure that the `master` branch is stable.


2. At least one review *must* be approved before a merge.

Recently Github added a review workflow to Pull Requests.  In addition to being able to assign a PR to someone you can assign reviewers that can approve, reject, or comment on your PR.  Enabling this option should require that you have at least one accepted review before a PR can be merged.  Again, this is something that should already be happening anyway but turning on this option will formalize the process.

I don’t want to make any sweeping changes without bringing this up to the team first as this may have impacts on other groups.  That said, we *do* need a formal development process and these *are* processes that should already be followed anyway.  Please let me know if you have any concerns as I’d like to enable this no later than the end of June.  Reply to this thread to engage on this topic.

Thanks!:::devops

Very interesting article about Microsoft trying to centralize code: <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bharry/2017/02/03/scaling-git-and-some-back-story/>:::devops
Microsoft chose to use git, but realized that it didn't scale.  So they re-imagined it and created a virtual file system for git that didn't require moving all the repo files to the local file system.  Unfortunately, they're work is Windows only, so I'm not sure it's particularly relevant to us:::devops
I think the lesson is that you can get Git to scale, but it's not easy.   It's a lot of the reason why off-the-shelf scalable tools like Perforce can be so attractive:::devops
<@W3PKKJTQT> <@W3PPUCPQU> <@W3SQJUTDK> <@W43KD0LJY> <@W3S3P9KN2> interesting in your thoughts...:::devops

Thanks. I'll have a read through.:::devops
<@W43F237PD|jeagle> has joined the channel:::devops
At what level did they try to scale? All of MS? I still think we should focus on scaling only to CDO and not take on all of IBM. Of course with the pivot that probably introduces some complexities:::devops
<@W3S3P9KN2> the article mentioned that they at least wanted to fit one whole project into a single repository, even if that project was Windows.  so that's a huge repository:::devops
but from day 1, we're focused on co-creators, so right now is the only time we'll be only CDO:::devops
right:::devops
so we need a scaling solution and we are somewhat bound to Whitewater offerings unless we can come up with a good reason to stray:::devops
<@W3S3P9KN2> agreed - can't take on all of IBM, but I think we can make a compelling case for many groups to develop with us:::devops
and scaling may be a good reason.....:::devops
I hope that we can stay with Whitewater - i'd like to see them offer a scalable solution:::devops
Came across this post and thought it would be insightful for this conversation here: <https://apps.na.collabserv.com/blogs/d3826d48-efdd-44a8-9238-5227fb20020e/entry/User_Experience_on_GitHub_ZenHub?lang=en_us>:::devops
I think we need to push on Whitewater. They did invite us to provide input. Maybe after the 15th we can get together and spend some cycles on this:::devops
Would love to get regular meetings with them - it would be great to stay aligned as I'm sure they're thinking about this as well.  Also, in another meeting I was part of, i heard that David Kenney has been pushing the same ideas - better tools for easier collaborations around development.  Would love to find someone in his org that is pushing in that direction.:::devops

I would love to have you there <@W3PJFN525> - in fact, it's actually very difficult to find a time to meet.  We need people from both PT and CET - which is 9 hours apart.  I'm trying to block off a weekly time at 11:30 ET, but there are many conflicts at that time.:::devops
Yes, that's hard! Would you like to add me as optional? Also, would it be helpful to have the meeting when most members are available but record it for those who cannot attend? :::devops
Done.  yes, i think that might have to happen.  Or have two meetings, one for Zurich and another for Victoria/San Jose.  And I think your timezone is one hour off from ET, so that would be much easier to schedule:::devops
For Eclipse users - if you are running builds on your vagrant image, how do you run unit tests in Eclipse?  Is there something you are doing to cause tests to run in your image, or are you reproducing your local image from your vagrant image?:::devops
why are thrift binaries only available on linux up to 0.9.1 while on mac, only 0.10.0 is available:::devops
<@W448040MV> iirc the Gradle won’t try to re-generate the Thrift sources if it notices that the source file(s) haven’t changed.  So if you do a build in your Vagrant image, then refresh and continue in Eclipse you _should_ be fine.  Alternatively, you could just provision a VM somewhere and run the `./install_dependencies.sh` script to install the toolchain and do your development on that VM.:::devops
but do the source files get stored in /vagrant on the image?:::devops
no:::devops
`/vagrant` is mounted to the host machine:::devops
so how do your built source files from the vagrant vm become available to your editor on your laptop?:::devops
are they built in the same directory?:::devops
yes:::devops
ok, so bazel works differently - it builds in bazel-genfiles and bazel-bin.  All jars are produced in a separate directory structure which then gets executed or packaged depending on the bazel command:::devops
and where is `bazel-genfiles` and `bazel-bin`?:::devops
It is generated in the same directory as a workspace file:::devops
<@W3PPUCPQU> and <@W3SQJUTDK> - my understanding is that you are now using VMs in Zurich to develop from.  Do you ever run Eclipse from those VMs?:::devops
No Java work for me :disappointed:  We do transfer a fair bit of data when deploying a new cluster and the speeds are good.:::devops
So, with <@W4D2FT57V> - we're looking into getting development machines for our India squad:::devops
I don’t usually use my development VM.  Mainly because I don’t have the time to write a lot of code these days.:::devops
Ajith has priced out roughly $1300 a seat per person:::devops
i'm in the same boat <@W3SQJUTDK>:::devops
I'm wondering what the folks in Victoria do since I would imagine developing, particularly complex pipelines, would be better if you had a local machine under the same environment as the prod infrastructure:::devops
To be clear: no one here is developing pipelines.:::devops
but you hopefully will be?:::devops
we are developing CaaS containers and UI's now.:::devops
Yes, I’d love to.  And assuming I do I’d probably be using a machine in Zurich or one in CSDC (so long as we have access to it):::devops
We ran into some problems with slight differences between ZC2 and CSDC machines so we're doing all platform dev on ZC2. Pod dev probably wouldn't see the same problems but just something to keep in mind.:::devops
<@W448040MV> is talking about using a ZC2 machine as a development workstation (IDEs, editors, etc):::devops
I know. but you were saying you'd probably use a Zurich or CSDC machine.:::devops
as a machine that you use for development.  I think the terms are getting mixed up.  By development I mean writing code, not a target for running your ansible playbooks:::devops
For development.. basically, where is Eclipse running from:::devops
And can you build/test/run from eclipse:::devops

We are using Bazel as a tool to coordinate builds and tests.  So far, the catalog-service project has been updated to use Bazel for its builds and its tests (you can see all the BUILD files throughout the directories.   The part that is missing is to not just build deployable jars, but build the containers.  Is this something that you would be interested in making work?  we'd like to create images that are compatible with your design for containers.  Here's some info on docker and Bazel.  <https://bazel.build/versions/master/docs/be/docker.html>:::devops

<@W448040MV> We have a couple of java services that we want to “dockerize”. These services are pretty much self-contained, i.e. need only a JVM to run. Is there already a docker repository where I could pull some base images for getting started? How does Bazel fit in here? Also, how can we run those in the Kubernetes environment that Rick and team have set up?:::devops
Hi <@W43KD0LJY> - thanks for the questions.  <@W3PPUCPQU> is the one to talk to about getting started.  

Bazel fits in as a single build tool that helps us drive consistency around our deployment process.  This only works in cognitive-data-platform/cognitive-data-platform, but you would create a BUILD file in the same path as your source code.  this BUILD file can have a few rules, java_library(...), java_binary(...), and docker_build(...).  The latter part is what <@W3SQJUTDK> and I proposed above to <@W3PPUCPQU> and <@W3PKKJTQT>.

And why Bazel?  It's a build tool that allows us to track and easily utilize our code-based dependencies across the entire repo:::devops
<@W448040MV> we haven't had a chance to look at Bazel at all yet. We're totally focused on the Alpha. However I will ask you and Bryan to have a meeting with Mike and I about the the approach and direction.:::devops
<@W3PKKJTQT> - it's not a directive to move to one or another build tool at the moment.  But it's something that we're heavily evaluating and is already in the code base.  I would absolutely like to meet up and talk about this.  it was part of our devops steering meeting which we can't get scheduled at the same time as Zurich unfortunately:::devops
totally understand and Bryan and I did talk about the benefits. We just want to understand what you and Bryan have been discussing and how we get there:::devops

Good warnings in <http://spr.com/selecting-streaming-framework/> for Flink and DevOps - we have to be careful to see if we have the same issues.  <@W3SQJUTDK> <@W3PPUCPQU> 

&gt;I would have chosen Flink (perhaps run under Beam), as it seemed to offer everything we were looking for. The team, however, ruled it out. As a distributed framework, deployment and operation would have been different from our current process and would have put unacceptable strain on our DevOps team. Flink also does not yet support the versions we use of Gradle, Mesos, Akka or Kafka. We also run inside Docker containers, so there would be no auto-discovery of nodes.

I'm surprised about the comments for Akka and Kafka as it does seems to support both just fine.  Akka is one of the dependencies for Flink.:::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> and <@W3PPUCPQU> - what is the use of <https://github.ibm.com/cognitive-data-platform/cognitive-data-platform/tree/master/ansible/playbooks/workstation> - is that to set up your workstation, and should we include other tools that are available from the build ansible scripts (based on discussion with <@W4GBXEHCK>):::devops

which VM are you trying to start? The vagrantFile from the root of cognitive-data?:::devops
<@W3PQ51X53> not exactly, but its a normal VM with Ubuntu iso image file on virtual box:::devops
Also, i am not even able to create a new VM for the same, can it be some memory issue? if yes, any idea around how can it be resolved?:::devops
Do you have virtualization enabled in your bios?  Look for either VT-X or AMD-V:::devops
yes it enabled.. before everything was working fine and all of a sudden this error..:::devops
Ok. Without any other information I don't have any other ideas. There should be some virtualbox logs which would contain more information.:::devops
shall i share them, will u be able to help then?:::devops
Pinging you on the side.:::devops
can you check if your using NAT or bridged networking? Make sure your using NAT.
<https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/10546>:::devops
Yup its a NAT network <@W3PQ51X53>:::devops
<@W4DAQ3V1Q> you good now?:::devops
figure out what your problem was?:::devops
<@W3PQ51X53> still trying to figure out what the problem is!!:::devops
do you have an older snapshot of an image you can go back to <@W4DAQ3V1Q> ?  Also, it shouldn't take long to create a new image if you'd like based on the ansible scripts.  The idea is that it should be one-touch:::devops
yea i created a new one <@W448040MV> ; only reason i want that to work is it had some files saved and all the code reviews we had that day, and some editing i did in the same code. right now started working on a new one :slightly_smiling_face::::devops
have you tried using a shared folder?:::devops
Yes Randy, I had shared folder in it(some files not backed up..unfortunately)..:::devops

and what about API framework and states? Guidelines on that?:::devops
what type of API framework?  What do you mean by "states"?:::devops
<!channel> Does anyone have any recommendations for libraries to process flags in Java.  I ran across <https://github.com/kennyyu/flags> which I like, though admittedly based on familiarity.  It was written by a former Google software test engineer intern who seemed to re-implement or open-source the internal Google flags library.

This library is nice as it allows you to define flags in the class where they are used.  Flags can be defined in any class, and at the top level when you run `Flags.parse(args)`, it will populate all defined flags.  It supports long and short names, an autogenerated --help screen, richer datatypes (lists, sets, maps), etc.  

Here's their example from the README.md
```
public class MyApp {
  @FlagInfo(help = "maximum number of threads to use", altName = "n")
  private static final Flag&lt;Integer&gt; maxNumThreads = Flags.valueOf(3);

  @FlagInfo(help = "use real logger", altName = "r")
  private static final Flag&lt;Boolean&gt; useRealLogger = Flags.valueOf(false);

  @FlagInfo(help = "input list", altName = "l")
  private static final Flag&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; inputList = Flags.valueOf(new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;());

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Flags.parse(args);
    System.out.println(maxNumThreads.get());
    System.out.println(useRealLogger.get());
    System.out.println(inputList.get());
  }
}
```

```
java MyApp --maxNumThreads=5 --useRealLogger -l=foo,bar,baz
```:::devops
For more complex stuff (like hierarchical configs), I tend to use apache configurations library.:::devops
Thank you <@W43KD0LJY> - let me take a look.  I also like the model as well of using a serialization library (e.g. thrift/protobuf) to store config info.:::devops

Here is an example of a highly successful agile company (where employees are both happy and highly productive): <https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/>:::devops
Would be good to learn something from them:::devops
And of course, here is the part 2: <https://labs.spotify.com/2014/09/20/spotify-engineering-culture-part-2/>:::devops
Interesting message: make *data-driven* decisions (what do end users want or need or like), instead of *opinion-drive, ego-driven, or authority-driven* decisions:::devops
I think we (IBM and CEDP) still have a lot to learn to get to this state:::devops
Did you all see this..  <https://developer.ibm.com/dwblog/2017/istio/>:::devops
<!here|@here> Would a tool like this be helpful here?  <https://insight.io/>:::devops
That's very neat. It would take a while to play with it and decide if it's fully featured enough to replace our favorite IDEs. It looks like it would have a lot of value even if it's not an IDE replacement for easy browsing and validation of code in git. Almost like having a permanent secondary pristine workspace which I've personally found very helpful in the past.:::devops
<@W3PPUCPQU> - I think it's value is just as a browser of code - I don't think that it can edit inside.  But, I'm thinking that as our code base becomes bigger, it's going to be harder to know where everything is or what has already been written, so a tool that allows you to quickly follow references (click on a method invocation, jump to the method or view the Javadoc) could be useful.  <@W3PKKJTQT> <@W3SQJUTDK> <@W43KD0LJY> <@W4C1YMBC7> - what do you guys think of a tools like this?  I've been chatting with the founders of the company and they're interested in our feedback.  And I'm wondering if this is something that would be useful for us?  And if so, how many licenses (just devs on CEDP, devs and co-creators, all of GCDO, all of IBM) and how much do you think it's worth per user?  thanks!:::devops
I honestly don’t see huge value-add over github, especially if you can’t edit code in there. There may be some value-add, but can’t say that it crosses my thresholds. But if others like it a lot, I won’t object.:::devops
There are also many other web-based code browsers, and/or editors, why is <http://insight.io|insight.io> better? For example: <https://www.koding.com/> (supports containers, has IDE, etc).  <https://codenvy.com/> (recently acquired by redhat):::devops
A high priority, in particular for co-creators and people that join CEDP, is to have improved *documentation* of the code - besides an improved user manual. This is more important to me than a better way to look at the code online. <@W448040MV> , I believe you wanted to decide on how to best incorporate GitBook documentation with Travis etc. Currently, my trial here: `<https://pages.github.ibm.com/cognitive-data-platform/coedl-ingestion/>` seems to be partially used by various people. However, it’s not complete. See also issue #1349.:::devops
<@W448040MV> I did a bit of the "Explore in Demo" and stopped when it got the the "now lets start editing code" part so I assumed it allows code edits online. Personally I find the Eclipse key strokes allow you to walk/run/jump through code so effectively I don't see insight being much value if it's just for browsing. I thought the value was as a thin IDE for those that don't want to/can't set up off-line IDE.:::devops
<@W43KD0LJY> - your documentation point is spot on.  There's a new person, <@W5KUC694Z> who is looking at that now.  He's a dedicated devops person in India.:::devops
<@W5KUC694Z|murugb34> has joined the channel:::devops
<@W3PPUCPQU> <@W3SQJUTDK> <@W5EMPQ3C5> - question for everyone.  Roukna is trying to create a docker image that she'd like to push to Kubernetes.  First stop is a local K8s on our laptop.  How should these docker images be created?:::devops
<@W3PPUCPQU> The value comes when there is more code than what you can browse in Eclipse...  and i'll see about editing:::devops
created? or stored and pulled during a deploy to to k8s?:::devops
to create it's just "docker build" with a build file. We don't have automated docker image building yet.:::devops
what is the image that should eb part of that base build?:::devops
<https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_docker#docker_build>:::devops
```
docker_build(
    name = "app",
    # References docker_pull from WORKSPACE (above)
    base = ["@java_base//image:image.tar"],
    files = ["//java/com/example/app:Hello_deploy.jar"],
    cmd = ["Hello_deploy.jar"]
)
```
This is the example:::devops
Can be just a bare centOS or Ubuntu or whatever is the most appropriate for the task.:::devops
what should we put as a "base":::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> what have the CaaS pods been build on?:::devops
but the code might have environmental dependencies:::devops
shouldn't it match the vagrant image, minus lots of development tools that shouldn't be part of the runtime:::devops
there's the install_workstation.sh script, but i almost think we need a few variations - one for vagrant, one for travis, one as a base for docker, and one for a full development environment:::devops
<https://github.ibm.com/cognitive-data-platform/cognitive-data-platform/blob/master/documentation/CaaS/Deployment%20Guide.md>:::devops
Looking at CaaS Dockerfiles centos:7 is the base image:::devops
hmm.  but we're on trusty for vagrant:::devops
thank you <@W3PKKJTQT> , going back over this with <@W5EMPQ3C5>:::devops
specifically, <@W5EMPQ3C5> is working on a framework to do A-B testing of models.  so it requires running at least two models that are parameterized, and pulling data from them to make a comparison:::devops
so the thought is that we launch N different versions of the same code, each with different parameters.:::devops
and this code might not be "checked-in":::devops
so we need to create these builds outside of K8s and push the builds:::devops
Yes that should be fine. Docker containers should generally do a single job. so you dont' want anything included that's not part of doing that job. otherwise every instance is wasted space, increased load time, overhead etc etc.  so running ansibles that we use to start up a build/dev env doesn't seem like it would be a good idea.:::devops
so Mike, is it possible to run the ansible script just once, and then store the image? and reuse that image?:::devops
I'm confused by ansible script. are you still wondering talking about the ansible scripts in /ansible/workstation?:::devops
And there's a related question on how Roukna can request a namespace...:::devops
yes, exactly..:::devops
the reason i'm bringing that up is because that is the environment that we develop these tools.  This is what Travis verifies is correct through our testing.  So, when we run it in production, we should have an identical (as much as possible) environment to run these same binaries.  Same OS, same JDK, etc.:::devops
Stop:::devops
if we are requiring a tool like "db2 client", there's a question as to whether that is pre-installed in the base image or if that's a dependency that's packaged with the binary:::devops
Ok, I stopped:::devops
Bryan, go:::devops
ok. I'm not sure you would want those for this. I *think* what you'd like to do is create a Dockerfile that defines the conatiner

The docker file will install java (assuming you're running java)
install the libraries needed
Install the build artifact Roukna is building (some stand alone jar)

add an entry point (the execute command when the docker image is started):::devops
We’re using CentOS:7 (as mentioned above) for the CaaS/NLQA containers that are built using Gradle.  However, for the Contracts CPI we’re using Ubuntu. The reason for the change is that Bazel (as far as I’ve seen) doesn’t support installing RPMs, nor does it support the `RUN` command since Bazel expects you to forego a `Dockerfile` and instead use Bazel rules.:::devops
Net-net, if you’re using Bazel, then 1) you aren’t going to be creating a `Dockerfile` and 2) you’re probably going to have to use Ubuntu.:::devops
we had to use alien to convert RPMs into debs:::devops
So you’re using Bazel to build your Docker images?:::devops
that's the idea.. the question is about what to set as the "base":::devops
if that's a workable path:::devops
Have a look at the Contracts CPI.  We had some fun with that since we ended up needing to call out every. single. package. that needed to be installed (due to transitive dependencies).  We currently download them directly from the source but I’d like to move over to a local binary repository so that we can avoid hitting external systems for out builds:::devops
I can’t speak to using Alien to convert RPMs to DEBs but if it works, go for it.  You’ll just need a place to put the generated .deb (unless you have an `alien` rule in Bazel that does it on the fly):::devops
I just wanted to point out that we’ve already done some of the leg work on this for the Contracts CPI.  If you have access to the repo then you can just see what we’ve done there.  If you don’t, I can add you.  In the near future we’ll be merging the repos so everyone will be able to see what we’ve done.:::devops
Thank you Bryan. I do have access, but would you mind adding <@W5EMPQ3C5> as well?:::devops
I'm very happy that you've already made some good progress on this:::devops
:::devops
and thank you <@W3PPUCPQU> as well for all this info:::devops
<@W5EMPQ3C5> should now have read access to the repo:::devops
where should we look in this repo, <@W3SQJUTDK>:::devops
<@W5EMPQ3C5> <https://github.ibm.com/GTS-Contract-Cognition/contractual-risk>:::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> - do you also think that we might need to split up the `install_workstation.sh` script into different ones for each purpose?  Vagrant, dev box, travis, base prod image, etc.?:::devops
mostly similarities but some differences:::devops
<@W5EMPQ3C5> who I was talking about:::devops
<@W448040MV> yes, I would agree with that. At a minimum we’d need one for a workstation and one for the build box:::devops
well if I chime in here, it would be nice to have a workstation script broke into 2 where we can have a headless one and a head one... the head one being the one with eclipse, vnc and all the other mumbo-jumbo :wink::::devops
Should we have one script with a few options available as flags?:::devops
I end up commenting out those pieces when I build my headless vagrant image anyways... :wink::::devops
ok, i'm glad it's not just me. ok, so we should really make this something that you can select on the command line.  What is the right way to do this in Ansible, <@W3PQ51X53> <@W3SQJUTDK> <@W3PPUCPQU>?:::devops
well since its all 'scripted' and provided this is the direction we want to go, I figure can be easily done by adding an ansible prompt to request what "mode" the user wants.:::devops
but the question arises, is this high enough priority to spend any time on... mind you it would be some quick changes but still time nonetheless.:::devops
@bryan We already have that minimum /ansible/palybooks/[build|workstation] however I think they have gotten a little muddied over the last few month.  If we only have 3 or 4 or 5 different configurations I'd like to just see those as playbooks that then pull in the dependencies they rely on.. most of them shared across multiple rolls. If we want to make if very customizable I would suggest some sort of properties file that allows on/off of all the features and then each person could have their own or multiples to reproduce very custom envs.:::devops
I agree with Mike..  we should limit the number of total configurations or perhaps the total number of dimensions.  If we think in configurations, we can have separate scripts.  If we think in dimensions (e.g. headless vs. head, dev vs. prod, etc.), then flags in a script might be better:::devops
<@W3PQ51X53> - i think this is a minor amount of effort to remove a friction point. Plus, this can save countless effort in dealing with environment challenges.  We'd want our build environment to be as closely aligned with our production environment otherwise our maintenance cost iwll be significant:::devops
<@W3PPUCPQU> <@W3PQ51X53> <@W3SQJUTDK> - can I ask someone in Victoria to revisit these scripts, at least to split up along the build vs. development dimension?:::devops
Yup. I'll create a task for it and add you as a subscriber. we can discuss more there.:::devops
Thank you Mike:::devops
you're welcome:::devops
<@W3PPUCPQU> Yes, thanks for creating the task to track the requests.  I’m not sure what the timeline would be for getting these changes done.

This may have been said above, but I think we should be doing all of the deployment as just Ansible scripts with roles for each of the different configurations.  We really shouldn’t have too many.  I can think of 2 off the top of my head: developer and build.  The build is a subset of developer in that it doesn’t need the interactive tools that a developer might use (Jupyter Notebooks for example):::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> has anyone created the bazel rules for generating Python from Thrift?  (for <@W5EMPQ3C5>):::devops
Nope.  We ended up just storing the generated files in source control. Python support in general with Bazel is a bit touchy.:::devops
Thanks <@W3SQJUTDK> - definitely not the ideal solution:::devops
we'll have to work through that:::devops
yup:::devops
the generation isn’t so much the problem, we can do that.  It’s the fact that the py_* targets don’t support a srcjar concept for Python.  Since we don’t know what files will be generated we can’t declare them as outputs.  And since we can’t generate an archive containing them all we can’t use that approach.:::devops
i would think it doesn't support a srcjar because all python is source:::devops
is there not a 1:1 mapping between a thrift file and its generated python code?:::devops
No.  One thrift file generates many python files.:::devops
why?:::devops
because that’s what Thrift does.:::devops
In theory we could zip up the files.  I’d heard, somewhere, that Python supports using zip files as modules.  However, I didn’t see this work flawlessly and I couldn’t spend more time looking into it.:::devops
we'll need to sit down and talk through some of these challenges and workarounds. Perhaps we can set up a few days in Victoria where we can visit and work all of this:::devops
not just Python/Thrift/bazel support, but the whole category containing these types of issues:::devops
I think the issue is just that Bazel is more rigorous than most other tools.:::devops
Another example that I’ll be running into shortly: Python with native dependencies.:::devops
that should work..:::devops
it works in the internal Bazel implementation:::devops
sure..but let’s say you’re developing on a Mac and now you want to build a Docker layer.:::devops
I’ll fill in the details (not that I’ve tried this but I imagine it will be an issue).  When you go to build the layer:

1. There’s no equivalent of a _deploy.jar (as far as I’ve seen) from Python so when I build the layer I get the start up script without the runfiles.
2. The naive implementation would just package up the Mac native dependencies which wouldn’t work under Linux.:::devops
what about this <@W3SQJUTDK> <https://github.com/google/subpar>:::devops
We can try it:::devops
this was written at Google..  the way it's done there is the generation of "par" files, so this rule builds par files:::devops
i seem to remember that building the .par might have been part of the internal py_binary rule, but I'm not positive:::devops
This is from the CIO DevOps team: health checks &amp; associated monitoring (e.g., <http://overseer.stage1.mybluemix.net/> ... <http://sup.rtp.raleigh.ibm.com/> ... ):::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> plus everyone else <!here|@here> - what do you think of using OWNERS files?  <https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/chromium-dev/XL4UUKYWNxE/-pt4mW8_R1IJ> <https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git/+/master/owners.py> to determine who is allowed and not allowed to approve a pull request for code changed in a directory?  Does it make sense to have per project owners that have ultimate control over their own code in the one repo?:::devops
Is this a well defined standard?:::devops
not at all.. it's a google originated standard.  and some people have been adopting it as they learn about it:::devops
i haven't see any other standards around that:::devops
Is there any tooling around these files? e.g. query to see who’s allowed to change what files? (this would have to be baked into our build/code review system):::devops
slightly interesting: we’d need to have the checks done against the version of the file currently on the master branch since there would be nothing stopping someone from making a change to the OWNERS file that would allow them access to modify files :smile::::devops
this is something that we still need to investigate.  There seems to be some tooling, but maybe not sufficient?  And that's an excellent point with the OWNERS file:::devops
<@W3PPUCPQU> <@W3SQJUTDK> see <https://github.ibm.com/wiotp-devops>, there's some base images for Kubernetes there:::devops

<@W448040MV> <@W3S3P9KN2> instead of the meeting tomorrow why don’t we just discuss it here:::infrastructure
ok, I like the idea, but we need Chris G and he is not in slack:::infrastructure
why do we need him again for this?:::infrastructure
it’s my infrastructure.:::infrastructure
none of the docs I’ve seen compels us to use at-rest encryption:::infrastructure
We are discussing whether to encrypt the entire disk or just filesystem (dir):::infrastructure
and Chris has this idea that I hate to encrypt at the HDFS level:::infrastructure
yes, that is what he said :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
I’m definitely against that:::infrastructure
fully:::infrastructure
especially as in a couple months we’re going to move to the new IBM ESS system that I’m ordering:::infrastructure
which has at-rest encryption:::infrastructure
True. Which is easier/quicker to implement? Disk level or dir level in HDFS?:::infrastructure
neither.:::infrastructure
as I’m against them :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
we’re not required to encrypt at-rest by the security documentation that I have:::infrastructure
please show me otherwise:::infrastructure
it came up as part of physical security compliance:::infrastructure
as we’ve discussed and Charlie agreed on one of our calls two weeks ago this is out of scope for the current deliverable:::infrastructure
it is simply not required as we’re neither doing card processing or financial processing:::infrastructure
the IBM ESS system is at-rest encrypted and once we move there this all becomes a tick anyway:::infrastructure
trip changed that. Racks are accessible by other people and the box used to store bad hard drives prior to demolition is also too accessible. Not comfortable with that. At rest encryption will complement physical access security and make us compliant:::infrastructure
how so?:::infrastructure
and why wouldn’t the racks be accessible by “other people”?:::infrastructure
if I go in an other DC I can access other racks.:::infrastructure
it is OK that they are. I expect that in a mixed environment:::infrastructure
there are no policies that force us to do at-rest encryption so this is something I’m going to pass on:::infrastructure
sorry:::infrastructure
:slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
it’s a controller G1 environment as defined by ITCS G1:::infrastructure
I am going to have a conversation with the CISO just to confirm:::infrastructure

Do you do this: The transfer of media to or from IBM sites, retention facilities, and disposal centers must be accounted for using transmittal records or an equivalent process.:::infrastructure
Wasn’t clear discussing with Hank:::infrastructure
Hank?:::infrastructure
you mean Frank?:::infrastructure
sorry, Frank:::infrastructure
I honestly have no idea. how it works is that I create an internal request and then drop off the hard drives.:::infrastructure
I hand carry the drives there (which is in-line with sec requirements) but I guess from there they have their own processes.:::infrastructure
that is part of where I had a concern. Drives ro be destroyed were stored in an open, cardboard box:::infrastructure
granted, in an access controlled room:::infrastructure
you can store _anything_ in a G1 controlled area.:::infrastructure
as per the internal ITCS104 standard:::infrastructure
btw I have zero idea about this box you talk about:::infrastructure
I definitely do not put hard drives in a cardboard box to get destroyed.:::infrastructure
ok. I will document that as such in the physical security area of the security doc that is replacing ITCS 104:::infrastructure
not sure what Frank has to do with any of this besides giving you guys a friendly look:::infrastructure
certainly what he thinks is the process might not be my process.:::infrastructure
ok, understood:::infrastructure
I did appreciate the friendly look:::infrastructure
he is officially not part of either the local IS team nor my squad :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure

canceled meeting:::infrastructure
thanks:):::infrastructure
We need to document everything discussed here in the security doc in GitHub:::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA> teh meeting tomorrow is with the CISO team. We met with them yesterday and they had questions about the network and infrastructure for the CEDP. No issues, just want to have a conversation. We are just trying to get the security compliance completed. Just so you are aware about the topic tomorrow:::infrastructure
sure:::infrastructure
thanks:::infrastructure
Thanks again Zoltan:::infrastructure
no worries. I bet they have not had a chance to play with an OpenStack environment.. :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
Nope, but it sounds like they are excited to get the chance :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
Hi Zoltan. Do you have any documentation that describes the environment you talked about on the call with CISO last Friday?:::infrastructure
I’m not sure what you mean.:::infrastructure
it’s a standard OpenStack environment:::infrastructure

<@W43F24XR9> is there any documentation on how Apache Ranger was implemented? can you share?:::infrastructure
<@W43KPK2NR> You can download the code and documentation from Apache, but maybe you meant something else ?:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> I mean how it was implemented in the CEDP - <@W3S3P9KN2> told me that we are using ranger for access control:::infrastructure
I'm still not sure what you mean by implemented.  Ranger is synced to our LDAP server that contains the user and groups. Groups are essentially roles. What exactly would you like to know ?:::infrastructure
I have not seen any documentation that we actually use Ranger - not in an arch diagram - not in any documentation - I am trying to find the documentation we have on the fact that we use ranger and how - you just mentioned LDAP integration - so I assume that is documented.:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> do any users have read-only access to browse the Ranger UI?:::infrastructure
outside of Zurich, of course:::infrastructure
Hi Randy <@W448040MV> actually I don't have access to the Ranger UI nor do any of the other developers on the project. Basically, because we don't need it. Zoltan's team do.:::infrastructure
Interesting. thanks <@W43F24XR9>:::infrastructure
So, what if we just want to browse/audit the permissions - is that exposed?  Is there any read-only access available?:::infrastructure
Not currently because there is no need. We wrote the means by which bluegroups are sync'ed to Ranger. The relevant bluegroups are  mapped one-to-one into Ranger.:::infrastructure
It is slightly more complicated than that because we needed some functionality ids with special permissions.:::infrastructure
maybe that information would be helpful to <@W43KPK2NR>:::infrastructure
Still not clear to me what the question is. Are you we using Ranger ? Yes. Where are we sync'ing from ? Bluegroups. How does this work ?  "<https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.3.4/bk_Ranger_Install_Guide/content/ch_overview_ranger_ambari_install.html>". Is there anything else I should know about Ranger ? Sure, a huge amount if you need to set-up, run and configure:::infrastructure
I am sorry that I am not clear enough - I am looking for any documentation that we have in CEDP about our usage of Ranger.:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> - your guidance is very helpful, thank you..:::infrastructure
i was curious, perhaps like <@W43KPK2NR>, on when/how additional services should be incorporated into Ranger.  For example, how should Kubernetes interact with Ranger?  How does it work with components that are not strictly in the Hadoop framework, and how do you recommend we integrate that?:::infrastructure
Architcture for example - user access documentation - anything - if we do not have anything documented yet - then lets just acknowldege that:::infrastructure
Right - I am working on investigating Atlas - Ranger can manage access control in Atlas too - but if in CEDP we have an architecture that only allows Ranger to manage access in the landing zone - then I want to know that:::infrastructure
if we have nothing - fine - I am aware of the documentation that exists for the Ranger project in Apache and Hortonworks:::infrastructure
I would like to hear your thoughts <@W43KPK2NR> on how it should be laid out.  <@W43F24XR9> and team used quite a bit of heroics to get us to where we are, but there's almost next steps that we can to reach a higher level of functionality and usability.:::infrastructure
I think based on what I have been able to learn from talking to people that we have implemented the basic access control capabilities of ranger - users/usergroups allowing access to resources. I think we need to lay out a plan to take that to the next level and start using tag based access control:::infrastructure
From my understanding of the functionality in Ranger - that will allow us more granular access control and enables us to use metadata tags to deny/allow and even mask:::infrastructure
we need to get a better integration between the governance team and the DE team to make that happen - because metadata management needs to be setup before we can use that functionality:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9|sro> uploaded a file: <https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/files/sro/F4FDNB473/cedpranger.pptx|CEDPRanger.pptx> and commented: Ok. I'm interpreting the question as do we have a slide with Ranger on it.  Here is a slide I presented at the Review in November with Ranger on it:::infrastructure
having said all that - I was looking into ranger - because of my investigations into Atlas - and this type of access control has nothing to do with that:::infrastructure

Hi <@W43KD3AMA> and <@W3PKKJTQT> - both of you guys have been nice to enough to offer to host the new Jira Data Center issue tracking tools.  We can either run it in Zurich or we can procure resources from BlueCloud to run it?  What should we do?  What is preferable?  They both sound like great options to me.  Zoltan has the experience to run this, and if he has the capacity in Zurich, even better.  On the other hand, running it in BlueCloud while costing more might save Zoltan's critical resources in Zurich for CEDP infrastructure and make for an easier transition if Whitewater is willing to accept it.  Either way, we can set aside a set of admins for the application of which all of us can be part of that along with <@W3S3P9KN2> and perhaps a few other individuals.:::infrastructure
It sounds like we can only get infrastructure support if we run it in Zurich, so it appears that is the only option. If Zolton's team is going to administer it I got the impression it had to be in Zurich and his team had to do the install:::infrastructure
<@W448040MV> I volunteer to be an admin:::infrastructure
BTW the DSX team just sent me info on the hardware needs, I'm just pulling it together and will send to <@W43KD3AMA> and <@W448040MV> today:::infrastructure
<@W3PKKJTQT> thats not exactly true. We can run it anywhere and happy to run anything as long as either we have someone backing us up with a support agreement with an SLA, or it's something we ourselves have developed. :::infrastructure
I don't care where it runs as long as it's an elastic, proper VM environment :::infrastructure
For most things running it on ZC2 allows them to have full bandwidth access to everything. :::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA> then it sounds like the best place to host Jira is ZC2. I believe the SLA with Blue Cloud is only for the bare metal not what's installed into it.:::infrastructure
For JIRA this is solved: the purchase includes support. :::infrastructure
At least for the first year:::infrastructure
great, so <@W43KD3AMA>, <@W3PKKJTQT> - can we just go ahead and download the DC edition so we can get it set up in the meantime under a trial until we get our licenses:::infrastructure

<@W43KD3AMA> We are using the Nova/DEV vms in Zurich to create a test platform to validate the    CaaS/CEDP work we are doing. Since PROD is RHEL we would like to get RHEL installed on a select number of VMs in that group. Is that a possibility?:::infrastructure
that’s a tricky one. officially we’ve licensed only the production zone for RHEL, not the test/dev portion.:::infrastructure
so I can’t help you without breaking internal rules, however, if you guys have ftp3 access (<http://ftp3.linux.ibm.com|ftp3.linux.ibm.com>) you can…:::infrastructure
and then you need to decide and accept the EULA there :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
(it’s the internal RHEL repository where IBM has a “bulk” license but it cannot be used for any other purpose than either developing an IBM product that needs RedHat compatibility or testing compatibility - which sounds like to me fits the bill):::infrastructure
Thanks, that could work until we get an official TEST zone in the future. The rules you outline above fit what we are doing which is validating the RedHat compatability for the IBM product we are building.:::infrastructure
you need to read the official EULA and T&amp;C on <http://ftp3.linux.ibm.com|ftp3.linux.ibm.com> then sign it yourself so don’t take my word for it :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure

<http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21990775>:::infrastructure
that technote from Cognos L2 support has details on how to connect to Big Insights from Cognos and the SSL config required on the Cognos side:::infrastructure
ok thanks let our team explore details:::infrastructure
right, and since Cognos on their support site is clear they support Big Insights if you have specific connection issues you should contact/leverage Cognos support:::infrastructure
it does appear from the documentation that the config does require some specific steps on the Cognos server side:::infrastructure
Thanks for details, let us analysis:::infrastructure
<@W43KPGC21> and I got Watson Analytics to work with CEDP.  The key is that you need a secure gateway, and you need the client running on Zurich. Also, once you get the client running, make sure to run `acl allow <http://bigsql.data.zc2.ibm.com:52000|bigsql.data.zc2.ibm.com:52000>` to ensure access to BigSQL.  I ran the docker command on a VM hosted in Zurich.  Perhaps we should set up a self-service way of getting these secure gateway clients launched?  <@W43KD0LJY> what do you think?:::infrastructure
<@W43KPGC21|archan> has joined the channel:::infrastructure
<@W448040MV> <@W43KPGC21> The secure gateway can run anywhere, doesn’t have to be executed in Zurich as long as it is executed on a host that can reach CEDP directly.
Is Watson Analytics cleared for the type of data that we have in CEDP? <@W43H2R0QJ> Daniel, do you know anything about this?:::infrastructure
I guess performance over the secure gateway isn’t really stellar. Would such a self-service be something that you would set up on the Kubernetes platform?:::infrastructure
<@W43KD0LJY> - i have had issues with WDP having a secure gateway in a location other than Zurich:::infrastructure

Please open a github issue and paste the image there. Opendata is not your sandbox, you cannot write into that. Opendata is a data source schema, it’s read only. Your sandbox is `SIDARKSH_IN_IBM_COM` and that’s also the name of the schema.:::infrastructure

Hi <@W43KD0LJY> - I said that <@W4EMK7GLV> doesn't have a sandbox.  That's not quite correct on my part, excuse me.  When I browse using the HDFS UI, I see the sandbox.  When I browse via Ambari (provided by <@W43KD1K52> ), I don't see it.  This makes me think that perhaps the Ambari view I was looking at might be the older dev environment instead of the prod environment.  Sorry for the confusion.:::infrastructure
<@W43KD1K52> As far as I understand, the Ambari view has only been installed on the test/playground system. There’s no Ambari on production (yet).:::infrastructure

<!here|@here> we (with <@W3ZHPFJN6> ) are discussing the possibility of having <http://Minds.ai|Minds.ai> writing some early inference models on CEDP.  We'd like to have them use the Spark cluster that is currently part of BigInsights.  Is this a use case that is compatible with the intended use of the BigInsights cluster?  If so, is there someone in Zurich that can help them get registered with the appropriate BlueGroup and help clarify the architecture, it's capabilities/limitations, and how they could get started?  Thank you!!:::infrastructure
<@W3ZHPFJN6|nmathur> has joined the channel:::infrastructure
You can find the BG list on git:::infrastructure
I think Grant owns the groups. :::infrastructure
But this really has nothing to do with infrastructure. This is a user support question. :::infrastructure
Hi @nag, the reason I thought that you should be involved in this is because the Spark cluster was intended for internal CEDP use.  I believe that <@W43F24XR9> had concerns about users exhausting the resources and internal CEDP pipelines being constrained.:::infrastructure
Hi Randy. The Spark cluster that is part of BI is a system resource that is only accessible to system accounts with a Kerberos TGT. No end user has access to the cluster, i.e. access is not BlueGroup based. The Spark integration workflows (such as putting data into ElasticSearch) are executed through oozie using appropriate system credentials. These workflows are typically data triggered, i.e. after dropping data to the DZ has been done. I believe that the latest architecture picture that I’ve seen proposes to use DSX-local for Spark jobs that are not part of the core CEDP ingestion or integration workflows.:::infrastructure
If a decision is taken to run additional YARN jobs (Spark or other) on the core CEDP, then a multi-tenancy resource allocation model must be implemented such that nobody can starve essential system workflows such as data ingestion. See: <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.2/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html>:::infrastructure
Provided you get the kerberos credentials you can run jobs externally, tho. :::infrastructure
Just to add to what <@W43KD0LJY> said. The 10 nodes that we have integrated for Yarn are used currently for (1)  ingesting data, i.e. creating compressed parquet files in parallel across the cluster from db2 using M/R,:::infrastructure
(2) Running Record linkage inSpark:::infrastructure
(3) Running the Datashop application in Spark:::infrastructure
Each application has (or should have) a distinct functional id.:::infrastructure
They all compete for the same resources, so one application can starve the others:::infrastructure
Ideally, in addition to having a distinct functional id, they should have their own Yarn work submission queue.:::infrastructure
Actually, when I write "ideally" what I mean is "essential". <@W43KD3AMA>, <@W43KPEXHB>:::infrastructure
<@W43KD0LJY> we have to evaluate on the capabilities of DSX-Local. On the current beta, only unsecured HDFS is supported. So currently we have no means of accessing HDFS. Support for secured WebHDFS is coming, I'm assuming through Knox. I'm trying to find out whether DSX-Local runs Spark in a way that could possibly support Kerberos, but I'm not holding my breath. So it is not clear at the moment that DSX-Local is the way to go.:::infrastructure
Also, access to DB2 over TLS is not supported yet (judging from the UI).:::infrastructure
<@W43KD1K52> What are the alternatives if DSX-Local isn’t ready yet? Running it in the core environment? Then we need to have some more advanced resource management than the current “winner-takes-it-all” approach.:::infrastructure
I don't know. We could set up our own secured Spark cluster and let users submit jobs to it. Otherwise, we need to change DSX-Local. Bring it on!:::infrastructure
<@W43KD0LJY> <@W43KD1K52> <@W43F24XR9> we have a few options for running pipelines - core infrastructure, DSX Local, and K8 cluster.  DSX Local has it's one K8 instance, and will be in the medium term merged into the main K8 cluster.  The K8 side is side is being engineering by <@W3PPUCPQU> and team to provide multi-tenancy from the get-go.  The biggest issue with it, as I see, is that it's not ready yet, but once it is, it will offer an alternative and perhaps better from the perspective of application isolation solution for running pipelines.  In the meantime, what would you suggest as an environment for <http://Minds.ai|Minds.ai> to run a particular Spark pipeline - the one that will be tasked with auto-generating metadata (reach out to #deep-learning-mindsai to decompose that overly broad goal)?:::infrastructure
<@W3PPUCPQU|mike.mcdonald> has joined the channel:::infrastructure
What would i suggest is (1) enabling distinct work queues in Yarn, (2) bounding the amount of resources each queue can use (3) creating a principal for <http://Minds.ai|Minds.ai> allowing them access to a specific work queue. <@W43KD3AMA> <@W43KPEXHB>:::infrastructure
please do open a ticket and we’ll get there.:::infrastructure
I did on Friday <https://github.ibm.com/cognitive-data-platform/cognitive-data-platform/issues/1187>:::infrastructure
great:::infrastructure
<@W448040MV> <@W43F24XR9> of course another option would be set up a second YARN cluster dedicated to Spark using the same HDFS. We would need extra resources for that though:::infrastructure
I'm assuming you can configure YARN and Spark to use non-standard users ( like yarn2 and spark2 say):::infrastructure
*nag@zurich.ibm.com* created new incident *DropZone slowness* with status *Identified*.  <http://manage.statuspage.io/pages/5lc5w0lf7vgl/incidents/h2ktk9q1tq9m|View this Incident>:::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA> why does a single disk failure affect performance?:::infrastructure
<@W43KD1K52> Hope we can avoid creating any additional single use pools of machines ion the future.  If anything, we should reduce the pools into fewer and fewer over time so we can get better resource utilization.:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> thank you Sean, sounds great:::infrastructure
many reasons.:::infrastructure
it needs to rebuild the array usually which degrades your performance.:::infrastructure
the controller might also disable caching in case of any failure:::infrastructure
we’ve seen this in the past with storwize:::infrastructure
nevertheless, the replacement drive should arrive tomorrow and in theory since the spare disk kicked in and the rebuild is not in progress this shouldn’t have any perf. effect:::infrastructure
but besides this there is nothing else that could affect performance:::infrastructure
@ Zolton please can I knwo if I can still access Drop zone?:::infrastructure
?:::infrastructure
why shouldn’t you be able to access it?:::infrastructure
ok, so here's another question <@W43KD3AMA>.  Can you make it so that any single disk failure does not cause degradation in performance or loss of data?  I think the latter is just fine, but correct me otherwise.:::infrastructure
no this is impossible.:::infrastructure
any disk loss will cause a temporary degradation in performance:::infrastructure
that’s how storage arrays work…:::infrastructure
what performance are we talking about Zoltan?:::infrastructure
?:::infrastructure
what do you mean?:::infrastructure
it needs to rebuild the underlying RAID array:::infrastructure
(which in this case already did, so _right now_ that’s not what is causing the issue.):::infrastructure
last time a canister failure happened the system disabled any form of caching which caused the degradation.:::infrastructure
I guess it behaves the same with a pulled disk:::infrastructure
@ ZOlton thanks for sharing and yes I confirm I can access:::infrastructure
in the morning we’ve ordered the replacement disk:::infrastructure
should be here tomorrow:::infrastructure
thanks Zolton so far I dont see any performance degration things look good to me:::infrastructure

Since some people are using Flink here and it is a while since we looked at it. I asked some of the folks here in Research contributing to IBM's Spark Initiative how worried they are by Flink and they told me that while they followed Flink for a while, it doesn't seem to have got much traction. For what its worth, I found this article quiet amusing: <https://thomaswdinsmore.com/2017/02/14/spark-is-the-future-of-analytics/>:::infrastructure
Thanks for this <@W43F24XR9>: Spark is a very good pipelining technology.  And I think we should support it (see <https://github.ibm.com/cognitive-data-platform/cognitive-data-platform/issues/1091> for an idea on how we can).  

There are two features of Flink that make it attractive as a *base* pipeline technology, and I specifically say *base* because not everything can or should be implemented in Flink.  The first feature is that it supports semantics for both batch and streaming.  It is helpful to have one framework cover both of those use cases.  The second is that it supports iterative pipelines.  This means we can run trainings, for example, in a loop, where the inner loop can perhaps include Spark pipelines.

I think the question is not which is better between Spark and Flink.  I think the only question is which would be better as a base pipeline technology that would work in hybrid technology pipelines.  I think Flink is strong on that front, but am welcome to other thoughts on that more limited purpose.:::infrastructure

Hi Randy <@W448040MV> I hope you don't get the idea I'm trying to persuade not to use Flink. I don't like Spark very much. As a Researcher I applaud trying new stuff and hope it goes well. However, as a Systems Engineer point I personally would worry about getting so far off the reservation. When the Flink guys came last year to Zurich to sell their stuff I found it interesting. But if the community has decided on Spark then I'm not going to fight the community.:::infrastructure

20 GB file in vi/emacs - that's not going to work..  yes, we certainly have no shortage of issues:::infrastructure
But, not micromanaging, however, we are absolutely allowing _everyone_ to have access to write to the cognitive-data-platform repo.  Why shouldn't we?:::infrastructure
I'm not talking about the repo. I'm talking about the organization's default setting which we agreed along with <@W3S3P9KN2> that will be changed to read only. :::infrastructure
And you as well back in February I think. :::infrastructure
The repo - sure. :::infrastructure
I just don't want people to be able to write to the infra repo. :::infrastructure
I agree <http://dropzone.data.zc2.ibm.com|dropzone.data.zc2.ibm.com> would be much more sane. I assume this would be a DNS alias and would round-robin to the three servers <@W43KD3AMA> ?:::infrastructure
Ok some ballpark figures to get ideas of sizing. We have a database called CEDPSHOP which is about 200 GB in size.
It took 4 hours to load this into the drop zone
It took 3 hours to ingest this into the Hadoop cluster
The final size of the database was 40 GB on parquet
Assume dropping/ingestion could be perfectly parallelized. It can't take less than 4 hours to ingest 200 GB.
Guestimate max total ingestion per-day. 1.2 TB.:::infrastructure
What 3 servers? :::infrastructure
landing-egress-db2-[1..3]:::infrastructure
There are 5 servers in the purescale xluster:::infrastructure
This but two of them are for caching:::infrastructure
Not sure if the CFs can be connected to as well or nit:::infrastructure
Yes:::infrastructure
As I said, once there is a ticket, we can deal with it. :::infrastructure
<@W43KPKL6R> John asked what is the max ingestion rate on the current system. While doing performance testing I measured some results for the CEDPSHOP database which I give here. These are just guestimates, but are a basis for discussion.:::infrastructure
it would be nice to know where the bottlenecks are.:::infrastructure
I’m pretty sure they are not on the HDFS side as it’s barely pushed:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> are you saying we need to raise a ticket if we think that we need to investigate a higher rate of ingest?:::infrastructure
<@W43KPKL6R> I think we need to know that (1) there is a limit (2) we need to know where that limit is (3) what is the bottleneck (It is different) for different cases. I'm not sure what creating a ticket would do, but if it help to document this then feel free.:::infrastructure
Stuff coming across remotely is general bound by the network latency and/or peoples inability to correctly set up datastage.:::infrastructure
if this needs to be measured across the infrastructure that will take manpower so if that’s the wish then -&gt; ticket:::infrastructure
else you accept what Sean has measured - 1.2TB/day:::infrastructure
I'm saying my measure is not out by more than an order of magnitude.:::infrastructure
i.e. it may be 12 TB but there is a limit:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> The Teams, as I have talked with them, are more interested in the ingest rate from Drop Zone to Landing Zone on a daily basis.  I think they are learning they have to do better on loading the data to the Drop Zone.:::infrastructure
<@W43KPKL6R> ok, my guess and (it is only guess) if a small number of TB, tops 10 TB per day.:::infrastructure
My guess is that for this function the current bottleneck is the generation of the compressed parquet which is very compute intensive:::infrastructure
The reason I suspect this is that it is not the size of the table that is the more important factor in its ingestion time, but its width.:::infrastructure
ahhh that makes sense actually:::infrastructure
i.e. very wide tables with hundreds of columns are really slow as (I think) parquets use a column based approch based on b-trees:::infrastructure
The good news is, one could buy oneself faster:::infrastructure
As <@W43KD3AMA> said it would be great to spend time getting real data on this, but (a) it would take time and (b) would requires a test infrastructure which we don't have.:::infrastructure
right:::infrastructure
People are using CEDP to ingest, build and query data every day and I'm not sure they would appreciate us working out where the system boundaries are.:::infrastructure
I don’t think they would be impacted.:::infrastructure
this is purely a monitoring-analytical exercise:::infrastructure
the problem is that someone needs to write the “plugins”, the “data collectors” that get the metric(s) out of a system and push it to our  monitoring:::infrastructure
Well I was thinking of generating a synthetic load and pushing th system until it collapses. Then you have your upper bound:::infrastructure
<@W447NPSQ6> told me “very soon” to get a yes/no/thismuch answer on our capital request:::infrastructure
as what you describe can only really be done a test system :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
although seeing that neither <@W447NPSQ6> nor <@W448040MV> wants to replicate the current prod system as a test system (“why” “costs too much” etc), I don’t see how those results would be relevant actually:::infrastructure
even if we had a small test system:::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA> - not 100% against a test system, but if we have extra capacity, it should be serving.:::infrastructure
I stand by what I said in our meeting @ *february* (just so people can see that _nothing happened_ in ~3 months):
- we need a preprod (test) system
- this system needs to be an exact mirror of the current production one:::infrastructure
including cores, memory, disk, etc.:::infrastructure
you want to effectively double the size of the infrastructure where 50% of it is tied to test?:::infrastructure
yes.:::infrastructure
and then bring in smaller instances for dev:::infrastructure
you're one of my favorite people Zoltan, but not going to happen... sorry my friend:::infrastructure
well then when people come to us “it’s slow” we’re just gonna tell them “no can do, sorry” :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
as <@W43F24XR9> will never be able to try to collapse any system where we could gather meaningful data from it:::infrastructure
it seems:::infrastructure
Think CI-CD and size of test infrastructure needed in due course.:::infrastructure
while people vi-ing a 20 gigabyte file?:::infrastructure
<https://github.ibm.com/cognitive-data-platform/cognitive-data-platform/issues/1331>:::infrastructure
beautiful ticket:::infrastructure
What about a test system on iRIS? I don't know how painful that would be, but having a SIMILAR system for testing would be already something.:::infrastructure
if we don’t care about a lot of things (CPU overcommit, speed, …) then we can set it up on nova as well.:::infrastructure
Works for me, at least one could run functional tests. Not meaningful for performance testing, but one could expect code to work more or less as is on production after testing. Now we "test" and then we do the actual testing on production ...:::infrastructure
once you guys give back the old production hardware, and we merge it to nova, AND we somewhere find time, we can maybe do this:::infrastructure
I don't want to get into some kind of catch-22 situation, but if you find the time to reuse that hardware for a test system, tell us and we can give it up <@W43F24XR9>:::infrastructure
well, give it up first and we’ll try to find the time? :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> using bi-guest-1 is a *temporary* solution that we want to get rid of really:::infrastructure
so onboarding _new_ people is not a good thing:::infrastructure
consider it given up, but keep it live until you find the time to make a test system out of its pieces :slightly_smiling_face: Once you find the time, how long would that take?:::infrastructure
no idea.:::infrastructure
can’t commit:::infrastructure
everybody is busy:::infrastructure
We currently run our containers (manually) on the guest1,guest2 and guest3 machines. We hate this for all the obvious reasons. When/if we have a Zurich Kubernetes cluster we'll run them there. Our current plan takes via Milan, we are evaluating whether that is feasible.:::infrastructure
explain ?:::infrastructure
btw, we were told yesterday that instead of Milan we’ll probably need a router towards AMS:::infrastructure
in the DWM call:::infrastructure
I wouldn't postpone a test system because of guest1 guest2 guest3.:::infrastructure
By Milan, I mean IRIS. Niels has a rancher running there, we would consider that a potential short term tactical solution.:::infrastructure
This is not a strategic solution as iRIS gives no SLA, but might be better than what we are currently doing.:::infrastructure
Since we started this discussion about performance. I would just point out that a test cluster on nova might be useful for some functional testing but in regard to measuring performance it would get you next to nothing.:::infrastructure
I don't think Niels' SLA is very good either :slightly_smiling_face: <@W4R7QHJSG>:::infrastructure
<@W4R7QHJSG|par> has joined the channel:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> I pointed out the exact same thing.:::infrastructure
and anything that you guys use for any task related to core infrastructure should be run by us:::infrastructure
I have no doubt <@W4R7QHJSG> can run the systems but we’ll be providing 24/7 on-call for the parts where we are responsible:::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA>, I'm in agreement that the core applications should be run by your team, but currently, today, some are by necessity run by us on machines we manage ourselves. Our strategic solution is run all active components on some docker orchestration cluster that dev-ops manages however they feel fit. But as you know we are not there yet. We are working out how to get from "here" to "there".:::infrastructure
sure. I’ve just told you where we should get to. :slightly_smiling_face::::infrastructure
I understand that there are temporary solutions in place.:::infrastructure
Hi Team:::infrastructure
Is there any channel , which address system level performance help ?:::infrastructure
or it will be address here ?:::infrastructure
what does system-level performance mean?:::infrastructure
there are so many aspects to performance - it could certainly be infrastructure:::infrastructure
but it could also be application level which shouldn't be here:::infrastructure
related to DataStage:::infrastructure
Is this related to the New Buyer work?:::infrastructure
right:::infrastructure
ok, let's chat offline about that:::infrastructure
thx , let me ask SME:::infrastructure
<@W43F256HH|vku> has joined the channel:::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA> is there any documentation on what versioning we are using for all the platform and its related software?:::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA>  do we have GPU machines in zurich data center?:::infrastructure
not yet:::infrastructure
<@W43KPKL6R> the latest from everything:::infrastructure
yeah:::infrastructure
<@W43KPKL6R> this wiki has the versions of the software:::infrastructure
<https://github.ibm.com/cognitive-data-platform/cognitive-data-platform/blob/master/documentation/CEDP%200.5/CEDP%200.5%20Application%20instances.md>:::infrastructure
<@W3PKKJTQT> good stuff thank you:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9|sro> uploaded a file: <https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/files/sro/F58MHBC6Q/ingestion.log|ingestion.log>:::infrastructure
Looking at the ingestion log after moving to full automation.  I recognize most of the users and functional users, but am wondering about the following: CEDPOMCS, CEDPSMS, CEDPSOAR. Who seem to be ingesting every morning. Can anyone explain ?:::infrastructure
I'm just curious:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> I would post that in #access_control I think it will get more attention from people that should now. Those look like functional IDs:::infrastructure
<!here|@here> can someone share the current situation for accessing VMs for development in Zurich.  Do we have any capacity remaining for such a purpose?  Thanks!:::infrastructure
there is no dedicated development environment in Zurich for the CDO.:::infrastructure
if there is capacity right now it could be taken by Zurich projects in a minute or not.:::infrastructure
That was my understanding <@W43KD3AMA> - i heard the contrary, and I wanted to verify with you:::infrastructure
going forward the plan is to put _some_ of the boxes into this zone so it’s shared for development, dedicate some boxes to K8s (or just run them bare metal) and dedicate some boxes to the production zone which can host the test env.:::infrastructure
ok, that will help.  We're also purchasing linux dev machines which I think is a cheaper option for us.  These are ~$1k servers that can support local development environments before pushing to ZC2.  I hope that we don't have every developer relying solely on VMs from your infrastructure, particularly since using Eclipse over a long-haul network connection can be painful.:::infrastructure

Has it been determined what job scheduler will be used on CEDP?:::infrastructure
<@W43H2R0QJ> I think that's what we are using Oozie for:::infrastructure
For what <@W43H2R0QJ>?  The internal processing is managed by YARN.   We're also adding K8s clusters on prem and in BlueCloud.  For co-creators, we would expect the K8s clusters will suit their needs:::infrastructure
Hi Team. We are not able to access bigsql hadoop  table from Flink. But we are able to connect to DB2 table from Flink. Is anyone had tried this before?:::infrastructure
<@W4GRE2LM7> Can you share any information on errors that you've seen?:::infrastructure
<@W4GRE2LM7|vinotk23> uploaded a file: <https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/files/vinotk23/F5F6Z4EGM/image.png|image.png>:::infrastructure
<https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPGG_11.1.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.messages.sql.doc/doc/msql01667n.html> - "This message is returned when an attempt is made to perform an operation against a table that is not supported with that type of table.":::infrastructure
HADOOP TABLE is not the same as a normal TABLE.:::infrastructure
BigSQL should not be used as just pure DB2 else it won’t use all the resources dedicated to it:::infrastructure
it cannot scale out non-hadoop tables:::infrastructure
(a design flaw, if you ask me):::infrastructure
Maybe BigSQL should scale out non-Hadoop tables as well. However, another reason to only use Hadoop tables is the fact that Hadoop tables very nicely integrate into the Hadoop environment:
* They are registered at the Hive Metastore and are therefore Hive tables as well
* The data is backed by well-known file formats on disk (Parquet mainly but also sequence files or text files if one chooses so)
* Above two characteristics allow that the data can be transparently processed by any tool in the Hadoop ecosphere such as Spark, PIQ, Hive or any M/R and exploit the full parallelism that the cluster infrastructure provides.

<@W4GRE2LM7>: It seems that you have been trying to use a scrollable cursor on a Hadoop table. Scrollable cursors are not supported on Hadoop tables as cursors assume a natural table order but in a cluster environment this is not possible due to parallelism.:::infrastructure
<@W43H2R0QJ> Regarding your question about job scheduler: For internal processing (such as ingestion and integration), YARN is used to allocate resources. There are different queues for different job types such that every job type receives a guaranteed minimum. The workflows execution is controlled by Oozie. Every Oozie workflow uses YARN to allocate cluster resources. The only component that is not governed by YARN is BigSQL which has been given a static fraction of the resources. BigSQL contains its own execution scheduler that it applies to the resources given to it.:::infrastructure
If anyone is interested in knowing how BigSQL works "under the covers" I would recommend:  Cloudera's Impala: A Modern, Open-Source SQL Engine for Hadoop <http://cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper28.pdf> as they are pretty similar.:::infrastructure
<!channel> We are planning for an outage next Tuesday May 23rd from 4 AM to 7 AM EST for maintenance purposes on IIS digital certificates and IIS cluster will go down:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9> how similar is it to <https://research.google.com/pubs/pub36632.html>, if you're familiar with that:::infrastructure
Impala and BigSQL are products that Cloudera and IBM support and hope to make money out of. Apache Drill is the Open Source Equivalent.:::infrastructure

My observation after this scheduled maintenance: I have been loading D&amp;B data from HDFS (Files) to DropZone(DB2) using DataStage for past couple of weeks. Normally I see around 2500 rows/sec throughput in DataStage. But after this maintenance, I have been running the same DataStage job and I see throughput dropped to around 1600-1800 rows/sec. Jobs are running fine but not sure why throughput/performance degraded.:::infrastructure

Could you please suggest what exactly is the issue:::infrastructure
I mean what exactly needs to be done to get this fixed:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> kindly help:::infrastructure
<@W5NNDRSAG> I guess your error caused by the error on <http://landing-egress-db2-1.datalake-infrastructure.zc2.ibm.com|landing-egress-db2-1.datalake-infrastructure.zc2.ibm.com>:::infrastructure
we can test it to be sure:::infrastructure
let me know the database name what are you trying:::infrastructure
TPRSS,DSW_TST:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> - Do you need any other info from my end to get this going:::infrastructure
no:::infrastructure
<@W5NNDRSAG> could you please try again connection from datastage using database alias TPRSS2 or TPRSS3 instead of TPRSS:::infrastructure
okay, Let me see:::infrastructure
and how about for DSW_TST:::infrastructure
Do we also need to use different database alias:::infrastructure
no, this is just for testing:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> - Let me test and confirm:::infrastructure
ok, thanks.:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB>  - Tried with TPRSS2 and can see data started loading, initially that was not the case:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> - which means whatever has been done for TPRSS2 can solve the issue:::infrastructure
currently we have an error with one of the DropZone servers <http://infrastructure.zc2.ibm.com|infrastructure.zc2.ibm.com>, <http://landing-egress-db2-1.datalake-infrastructure.zc2.ibm.com|landing-egress-db2-1.datalake-infrastructure.zc2.ibm.com>:::infrastructure

<@W43KPEXHB> - By when i can expect this will get resolved:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> - Is it possible for you to catalog some of the databases through different server:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> - Your input pls, need to test some job today so trying to expedite the process:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> - *Process - thing:::infrastructure
yes, I can do it for now:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> - Please do it for TPRSS, dsw and dsw_TST:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB> - Name of the cataloged database would be same or you would change that:::infrastructure
<@W43KPEXHB>  - The way you did for TPRSS:::infrastructure
I'm going to uncatalog the tprss2 and tprss3 then re-catalog with the original name but using the different server:::infrastructure

To purchase BigInsights on K8 (that's what bluemix runs) <@W448040MV> <https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?taxonomyNavigation=apps&amp;env_id=ibm:yp:us-south&amp;search=BigInsights>.:::infrastructure
Thanks <@W43F24XR9> - i was wondering if we could run BI on our K8s cluster, not on Bluemix:::infrastructure
not officially.:::infrastructure
AFAIK there are no public releases of a containerised biginsights product.:::infrastructure
there isn't, they have an un-supported 'get started' version they ship that runs in containers right now.. but no supported versin:::infrastructure
it would be worth reaching out to the team to see if it is on their roadmap, especially since they do ship that one version in containers (although not for PROD use) they may have something coming out:::infrastructure
Ok, but Bluemix runs on Kubernetes, and BI runs on Bluemix, so logically it can be done, which is all my point was. Docker is a just a container. You can run whatever you want in it.:::infrastructure
everything is possible, yes.:::infrastructure
supported? not.:::infrastructure
Different discussion.:::infrastructure
I do have a paid, full account on bluemix:::infrastructure
Sean - I was just probing as to when some of these tools will be architecturally separated so that the different pieces can run on K8s, we can dynamically scale BigSQL to as many instances as we need, Spark jobs are running on the same K8s and are limited to just the BI environment, etc.  The same goes for IIS - when can we run each of these tools independently as "stateless" servers communicating with replicated consistent data stores.:::infrastructure
probably never.:::infrastructure
<@W448040MV> for IIS, I am not sure about the official plan for this from product team but technically, I am thinking of using DB2 replication to replicate small instances for each services to each other as all IIS services are using DB2 as repository backend. It is theoretical:::infrastructure
<@W43F24XR9|sro> uploaded a file: <https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/files/sro/F5Q2QMJF5/screen_shot_2017-06-07_at_18.10.30.png|Screen Shot 2017-06-07 at 18.10.30.png>:::infrastructure
that’s hosted on bluemix.:::infrastructure
0.67 CHF per node per hours looks quite cheap. Unfortunantly, the production ready version of BI (with all the Watson + BigSQL tool etc) runs on bare metal and you have to contact an IBM sales person to find out how much it costs.:::infrastructure
randy was talking about on-prem I think.:::infrastructure
I looked at this with Luis some time back to work out the cloud offering for BI (Yes Zoltan we are always looking for alternatives). We spun up a cluster and it all runs on K8.:::infrastructure
<@W43H2NH26> This is an interesting direction.  I hope we can evaluate this once we get over our current governance hurdles:::infrastructure

I see that IIS engine was re-started at 9:59 AM on June 27, 2017 (This morning). Do you know if we started the entire IIS (Including WebSphere and ASB Agent) or just engine. Thinsgs are looking better now..still slow but moving.:::infrastructure
the jobmonapp was hung and could not figure out any way to restart just that, so I restarted the engine only.  logs indicate jobmonapp runs out of memory and hangs...and looks to have been doing that periodically since May 25th 2017:::infrastructure
Yes..I see that jobmon process is running now.:::infrastructure
And I can see job statistics which were not showing before since jobmon was down:::infrastructure
<@W43H2T54J> correct, that is one of the main purposes of jobmonapp:::infrastructure
Other thing you might want to check is job log folders. If Job Logs are not set to purge periodically at project level..they can get huge and may cause performance issues reading metadata for a job.:::infrastructure
<@W43H2T54J> If you are referring to swg21423485, already checked that, and that condition does not exist currently:::infrastructure
what is swg21423485 ? I was just making a general commend based on my prior experience with Information Server.:::infrastructure
reference to the link posted in github issue 2590:::infrastructure
Oh OK. No I am talking about log files. They can grow quickly if not set to purge periodically.:::infrastructure
yea I've noticed they're all defaults with no rotation.  So far its not a problem, but yes that is something I am planning to get corrected:::infrastructure

This topic came up in conversation.  How do we decide that a software service should be provided as a single shared multi-tenant service or provided to each user to run in their own containers on a per-job basis?  

The following article gives some nice commentary on the tradeoffs: "Today I think 'common knowledge' is to go multi-tenant. Tomorrow however I wonder whether containerization may make it just as efficient to spin up containers per customer."

we don’t want them to mute it.:::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA> and <@W3PKKJW1Z> - should we create a channel like "cedp-incidents" or "cedp-outages" for the type of information Rodney is sharing.  It's very important and helpful for that to be disseminated, but I'm not sure if automated messages should be mixed in the same channel as incident communications.:::infrastructure
statuspage posts here.:::infrastructure
statuspage IS the means of communicating outages and such:::infrastructure
we can change where it posts if we want to and make that read-only. I think I can set up a channel like that:::infrastructure
how about #cedp-status and then bots (inc. statuspage) post there?:::infrastructure
<@W43KD3AMA> could you please grant <@W3PKKJW1Z> access to status page as mine to be able to post outages?:::infrastructure
yes, just have it documented please, open a ticket on github and tag it with infrastructure:::infrastructure

Just getting into using Slack more and see this channel. Four months and no flimflam or jibber-jabber?? Well here 'goes.... spent part of my Saturday assembling a 6'x4' (150+-pound) armoire from Ikea to help support my wife's shopping habit. I could go on-and on about the whole Ikea experience (my 1st time buying/assembling from there). I will give a ton of credit to the team that illustrates their assembly instructions. With ZERO words, they make it 100% clear what to do. That said.... yes... I would like the 4.5 hours back in my life!  Ok.. back to non-flimflam stuff.:::devops
more importantly, Barnum has just announced that the last performance of the Big Top will be May. So sad :unamused::::devops

I cool (I thought) tip I recently learned (thanks YouTube!) for the DOS/CMD prompt. And yes, I still make good use of the DOS prompt!

If you don't want to bother with 'cd' to change directory paths -- especially when it may be a long path: Open windows explorer and drill into the folder you care about. Then on the address bar of Explorer type 'cmd' and press enter. A DOS window will launch and the path will be set. Happy DOS-prompting!:::devops

I'm not a huge fan of Verse yet (except for its search), since my huge beef with it is where it consumes a LOT of screen for minimal content. Just came across this TAP plugin and installed. Seems to enrich the screen a bit. I make no claim of its stability! <https://tap.innovate.ibm.com/app/4156>:::devops
Go Patriots :slightly_smiling_face::::devops
I gave up on Verse. There is a MS outlook program available if anyone wants to use that:::devops
Did you see the new calendar update in Verse?  it seems like a modest improvement:::devops
Yes, I saw it last night:::devops
It’s a step in the right direction.:::devops
Oh love the new calendar view! Looking forward to see it working :heart: -- And I love verse :speak_no_evil::::devops
I would love to know how Verse works well for others. I just don't get it. The best features (to me) are search and that it's browser-based (so when my Notes client crashes and takes 30 mins to fire-up again I can use Verse as an emergency backup):::devops
I will come back to talk about this, after my meeting. hopefully I can help you see some benefits :wink: :pray::skin-tone-4::::devops
not urgent, and wasn't trying to have anyone do work to pull materials together.... some people like the tool and would be interested to understand why... thanks in advance:::devops
No problem, <@W43F25BGB> ! It's actually a pleasure :slightly_smiling_face: -- I love how verse pulls threads of emails together. How it connects with BOX, with Connections Cloud and with Meetings. I love how it shows me I have unread mail from my VIP people (easily configured by myself). I love the search capability, the ability to remove from inbox without the worry of organizing in folders (the minus sign). I love that I no longer archive, that I access mail from my phone or laptop, that I get no more mail jail :slightly_smiling_face::::devops

I feel like a bit of a slacker for chiming in on this, but it's necessary to clarify that the new Fibonacci joke wasn't actually better than its two predecessors, but it was just as good as both of them combined.

<@W43F25BGB> how is the Calendar working for you?  Not sure if its me, but online version is missing several entries and I have to go back to Notes to make sure I don't miss any meetings.  I haven't been able to identify a pattern yet...:::devops
<@W43F22267>  I haven't (yet) had an issue with missing entries -- that I know of! My issues with its mail/calendar are many of the missing (useful) features of Notes. I want Verse to work, but there's a long and growing list of things that Notes just does a lot better.:::devops
This is not a fully random question, but would folks here be willing to follow or join a channel for support questions on usage of CEDP?  I'm noticing that as I am using the system, I'm having lots of questions where it's sometimes difficult to track down the person who knows the answer:::devops
<@W448040MV>  excellent idea:::devops
yes:::devops
how about naming this channel "cedp-users"?:::devops
or.... CEDP-FAQ  or.... CEDP-HowTo.... just thoughts:::devops
how about cedp_05_support:::devops
and now <@W43H2R0QJ> you are adding a discussion about _ vs. -.  that's more of a <#C2FBNKJ03|random> conversation:::devops
<@W3S3P9KN2> and <@W3ZHPFJN6> - always two folks with interesting ideas?:::devops
<@W3ZHPFJN6> suggests cedp-help:::devops
I think having a place to ask questions and have people work through how-to-do things is a great idea. We can even use threads for topics, and as the answers mature we can curate them and move them into a more formal wiki/community FAQ. The channel can be exploration:::devops
I also think we should have an outage channel to track when (as if) parts of the CEDP may be down and what  the status is of resolving:::devops
so some of the names are around "support", "users", "help", and "howto":::devops
suhh:::devops
"users" is not judging that there's a problem - that's why I like that term:::devops

the use case being I have ansible scripts that need to 'get' these files for install and we do not want to put them in Git.:::devops
eg. files like .rpm files, docker images, vagrant images, etc etc.:::devops
Zurich is working on getting Spectrum added to the environment so you will be able to have file system storage in the environment:::devops
Why not in Git?  That is the right usecade:::devops
Use case:::devops
these files can be quite large and every change will end up cascading the large downloads to everyone that is using that repo.:::devops
<@W43H2R0QJ> this Spectrum server, is the intention to use for dev system storage? or do you mean something else like for prod? Just want to clarify.:::devops
or both!:::devops
it is the UI to access the file system
<https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/wikis/home?lang=en#!/wiki/General%20Parallel%20File%20System%20%28GPFS%29/page/Object%20Store>:::devops
<@W3PQ51X53> - for the ansible scripts, can they all be in git? (<http://ibm.biz/cedp-code>):::devops
for the files that are downloaded, we can host them off WebHDFS:::devops
push them as unstructured data into CEDP:::devops
You can provision a VM in Zurich to run those scripts:::devops
<@W448040MV> Yes I have the ansible scripts in Git and a vagrant image (that is currently hosted in box) downloaded and running on my laptop to run the ansbile scripts. So for the most part I am 'working' its just the large artifacts I need to dump somewhere. I will look at WebHDFS.:::devops
Is there more information around WebHDFS? Like getting access, provisioning a storage container, etc?:::devops

i would say it was exciting and engaging for 3 quarters.  I blocked the rest out of my memory.:::devops
you are right Randy !!:::devops

<@W3SQJUTDK> the better war would be, Tabs vs spaces!:::devops
<@W3PQ51X53> I think the tabsVsSpaces (<@W448040MV>) war is settled.  Tabs for indentation, spaces for alignment. :mic-drop-522::::devops

IDoNotThinkAnyThingIsResolvedYetIdoBelieveWeNeedToGetATaskForceTogetherToIdentifyStandards:::devops
<@W448040MV> and myself have already looked into it.  We’ve standardized on whimsy.:::devops
<@W3SQJUTDK> That statement is incomplete unless you specify how many spaces a tab represents.:::devops
I know <@W448040MV> is full of whimsy:::devops
not true.:::devops
aligning with spaces means that you still indent using tabs to the appropriate level, but then you use spaces to align text with surrounding code.  For example, if you split a parameter list for a function definition across multiple lines, the parameters will be indented to the same level as the function, but spaces are used to align the parameter names with the other parameter names.:::devops
whoah there <@W3SQJUTDK> - i don't think that's settled.. i'm ready to take off the gloves:::devops
:smile::::devops
spaces all the way, no exceptions, ever, ever ever!!!!:::devops
i actually like it when an editor supports tabs but stores it as spaces so it looks the same on all systems:::devops

You're not taking into account the fact that some coding style guidelines involve the maximum length of a line, and unless you know how many spaces a tab represents, you will get different wrapping points for the lines.
Also, if you use tabs to indent and then spaces to align text with surrounding code, you also need to know how many spaces a tab represents or else your alignment with your spaces will be off.
Much better to just use spaces everywhere.:::devops

WebEx is actually perfect for this:::devops
zoom can handle 50 concurrent users:::devops
I think zoom is better for smaller groups even though it can handle more:::devops
i agree - Grant, I think that WebEx is a good tool for these types of meetings where there is a huge number of people.:::devops
Webex is the IBM strategic video conferencing tool - and it allows sharing of confidential files - on zoom you are not allowed to do that:::devops
Hangouts business can handle 25, Google Meet (For Enterprise) handles 50.  but Hangouts provides Chromebox for Meetings that easily converts conference rooms into a single participant:::devops
We don't have any restrictions around Hangouts at the moment (based on Amir's security review):::devops
I think we do:::devops
I'll forward the email <@W43KPK2NR> - please share with me any and all other concerns...:::devops
Interesting, hosting a meeting with Kavanaugh , Jeff Smith and Inderpal and guess what they are using..(and of course IBM confidential material there) .... Zoom:::devops
<https://w3.ibm.com/help/#/article/14602>:::devops
Google hangouts are not approved for either discussion of confidential material or sharing confidential files:::devops
apparently zoom has been approved for sharing confidential files - but I think you need to be on IBM enterprise zoom:::devops
you do need to be on the Enterprise Zoom, but I still feel it is better for smaller groups:::devops
<@W43KPK2NR> - that's outdated:::devops
I like zoom much better than webex:::devops
CIO has been meeting with Google lately:::devops
I use both for different purposes:::devops
I use Zoom as default:::devops
<@W448040MV> just read your email - evidently the official policy has not been updated yet:::devops
<@W43KPK2NR> am I correct in my interpretation that Hangouts should be safe for use just according to that email?  For storing confidential data, I think we're still needing to come up with an approach to get SSO working:::devops
if we purchase the enterprise version of gsuite, and we have integration with W3 ID - then I would agree that based on that email it should be allowed:::devops
but public google hangouts - are not safe:::devops

<@W43F25BGB> - it was further north from there.   the bridge collapse separated the connector (which is where I-75 and I-85 split) from the rest of I-85 and GA-400.  I-75 is not affected.  This impact people traveling from midtown and downtown Atlanta to north and north east of Atlanta.  Those who live more on the west side (<@W3ZHPFJN6> and me) are unaffected.  <@W43KPLP45> would be affected if he were commuting to midtown or downtown, but our IBM office is north of the city.:::devops

If you're looking for a good, e.g. thought provoking, enlightening, informative, podcast to listen to, you may want to consider Ezra Klein (<https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show>).  His most recent interview was with Cal Newport who discussed his research on "Deep Work."  Ezra's POV: "I was asked recently to name a book that changed my life. The book I chose was Cal Newport’s “Deep Work,” and for the most literal of reasons: it’s changed how I lived my life. Particularly, it’s led me to stop scheduling morning meetings, and to preserve that time for more sustained, creative work.":::devops
On Ezra's podcast, Cal Newport recommended a few books including: <http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6683549-you-are-not-a-gadget>:::devops
Another recommendation from Cal Newport was:  <http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25734304-throwing-rocks-at-the-google-bus>:::devops
Information on Cal Newport's book on "Deep Work" can be found here:  <http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/>.  A summary from the website:  "Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It’s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep—spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there’s a better way.":::devops

Happy Monday!!  To get your week off to a good start, some quotes from Steven Wright (maybe my favorite comedian):
1 - I'd kill for a Nobel Peace Prize.
2 - Borrow money from pessimists -- they don't expect it back.
3 - Half the people you know are below average.
4 - 99% of lawyers give the rest a bad name.
5 - 82.7% of all statistics are made up on the spot.
6 - A conscience is what hurts when all your other parts feel so good.
7 - A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.
8 - If you want the rainbow, you got to put up with the rain.
9 - All those who believe in psycho kinesis, raise my hand.
10 - The early bird may get the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
11 - I almost had a psychic girlfriend, ..... But she left me before we met.
12 - OK, so what's the speed of dark?
13 - How do you tell when you're out of invisible ink?
14 - If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.
15 - Depression is merely anger without enthusiasm.
16 - When everything is coming your way, you're in the wrong lane.
17 - Ambition is a poor excuse for not having enough sense to be lazy.
18 - Hard work pays off in the future; laziness pays off now.
19 - I intend to live forever ... So far, so good.
20 - If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends?
21 - Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.
22 - What happens if you get scared half to death twice?
23 - My mechanic told me, "I couldn't repair your brakes, so I made your horn louder."
24 - Why do psychics have to ask you for your name
25 - If at first you don't succeed, destroy all evidence that you tried.
26 - A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking.
27 - Experience is something you don't get until just after you need it.
28 - The hardness of the butter is proportional to the softness of the bread.
29 - To steal ideas from one person is plagiarism; to steal from many is research.
30 - The problem with the gene pool is that there is no lifeguard.
31 - The sooner you fall behind, the more time you'll have to catch up.
32 - The colder the x-ray table, the more of your body is required to be on it.
33 - Everyone has a photographic memory; some just don't have film.
34 - If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you.
35 - If your car could travel at the speed of light, would your headlights work?:::devops

<@W3S3P9KN2> No, I tried to get all artsy with it.  That’s a picture of a reflection of the pit. :smile::::devops

Anyone watching WWDC? Did you see Siri’s improvements?! This is real innovation!!:::devops
what changed?:::devops
<@W448040MV> pronunciation/tone and translation; for  the former, it can say the words “sunny” with three different tones in one sentence; for example, “the weather for the next three days are sunny, sunny, and sunny”; each “sunny” will have its own tone depending on the sentence:::devops
did they announce the Suri speaker?:::devops
Very nice... getting realistic voices is very hard:::devops

A good [D3!] summary of GoT events while we are waiting for the new season to start in a month! <http://jeromecukier.net/projects/agot/events.html>:::devops
<@W43H2SS82> I have yet to watch an episode of GoT.  Do you suggest just starting from season 1, episode 1 and catching up?:::devops
<@W448040MV> yes if you haven’t read the book. It has a big ecosystem (!) that’s difficult to understand if you don’t start from the very beginning. Also, right in the first season, there are multiple very important events that you don’t wanna miss!:::devops
Great, thanks <@W43H2SS82> , when things calm down,I'll see if i can squeeze in a few episodes.. looking forward to it!:::devops
